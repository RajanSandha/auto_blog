### What is NYT Connections: Sports Edition?

*Connections: Sports Edition* is a word association game where you need to find the common threads between words related to the world of sports. Think of it as a combination of word association and trivia, challenging you to identify the hidden links between seemingly disparate terms. The game is available on web browsers and mobile devices, making it easily accessible wherever you are.

*   **The Goal:** Group four words that share a common connection.
*   **The Challenge:** Each puzzle presents 16 words, and you need to identify four categories containing four words each.
*   **The Catch:** Multiple words might *seem* to fit together, but there's only one correct solution for each category.

### How to Play Connections: Sports Edition

The gameplay is simple yet strategic:

1.  **Analyze the Words:** Carefully examine all 16 words presented in the puzzle.
2.  **Identify Potential Connections:** Look for words that share obvious or subtle relationships. Think about sports teams, athletes, equipment, rules, and terminology.
3.  **Group the Words:** Once you believe you've found a connection, select the four related words.
4.  **Submit Your Guess:** Confirm your selection and submit your guess.
5.  **Learn and Adapt:** If you're correct, the four words disappear from the board. If you're wrong, you'll get a mistake. You have a limited number of mistakes before the game ends.

**Pro Tip:** Don't be afraid to shuffle the board! Rearranging the words can sometimes reveal hidden connections that you might have missed initially.

*   **Use Your Mistakes Wisely:** If you're unsure, make a guess and see what happens. Your mistakes can provide valuable information and help you narrow down the possibilities.
