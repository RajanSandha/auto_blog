## AI as a Creative Partner? Eliza McNitt Defends AI in Filmmaking

Director Eliza McNitt, known for her immersive VR experiences like *Fistful of Stars* and *Spheres*, is now exploring the intersection of art and artificial intelligence in her short film, *Ancestra*. In a recent interview, McNitt discussed her use of Google's AI tools in creating the film and defended the role of **AI** as a creative tool, sparking a debate about the ethics and potential of **AI** in the arts.

### *Ancestra*: A Personal Story Told with AI

*Ancestra* tells a deeply personal story of McNitt's own traumatic birth. She collaborated with Google DeepMind and Darren Aronofsky's studio, Primordial Soup, to blend live-action footage with **AI**-generated media. The film depicts a mother's experience during an emergency delivery, exploring themes of connection and the universe. The **AI** was used to create visuals that would be impossible to capture with traditional filmmaking techniques, such as the inner world of the womb and cosmic imagery.

### The Ethical Considerations of AI in Art

McNitt acknowledges the ethical concerns surrounding the use of **AI** tools, particularly the fact that many models are trained on copyrighted material. She believes that each artist must decide for themselves how to use these tools responsibly. In the case of *Ancestra*, she felt that using **AI** to create a computer-generated infant that resembled her as a baby was more ethical than using a real newborn or a digitally animated doll.

"I felt the use of **AI** was really important for this story, and I think it's up to every artist to decide how they wanna use these tools and define that," McNitt stated. She emphasized the importance of maintaining human actors at the center of the story, believing that human performance cannot be replicated by machines.

### Collaboration with DeepMind Engineers

McNitt worked closely with a team of DeepMind engineers to craft prompts and sift through the generated footage. This collaborative approach highlights the importance of human oversight and artistic direction when using **AI** tools. The process wasn't simply about plugging in prompts and generating low-effort footage; it required careful curation and refinement to achieve the desired artistic vision.

### Addressing Concerns About Copyright and Compensation

McNitt also addressed concerns about **copyright** and **compensation** for artists whose work is used to train **AI** models. She believes it's the responsibility of companies to respect artists and establish boundaries to prevent exploitation. As **generative AI** evolves, it's crucial to ensure that artists are fairly compensated and that their **copyright** is protected.

### The Future of AI in Creative Fields

McNitt's work raises important questions about the future of **AI** in creative fields. While **AI** offers exciting new possibilities for artistic expression, it also presents ethical challenges that must be addressed. The key is to use **AI** as a tool to enhance human creativity, rather than replacing it entirely. By collaborating with **AI**, artists can push the boundaries of what's possible and tell stories in new and innovative ways.

### Actionable Takeaway: Experiment with AI Tools Responsibly

If you're an artist or creator, explore **AI** tools but do so mindfully. Consider the ethical implications, ensure you're not infringing on **copyright**, and prioritize human creativity and storytelling. Experiment with different **AI** platforms, learn how to craft effective prompts, and collaborate with others to refine your results.

### Key Takeaways

*   **AI** is being used as a creative tool in filmmaking, offering new possibilities for visual storytelling.
*   Ethical considerations, such as **copyright** and **compensation** for artists, are crucial when using **AI**.
*   Collaboration between artists and **AI** engineers is essential for achieving artistic vision.
*   **AI** should be used to enhance human creativity, not replace it.
