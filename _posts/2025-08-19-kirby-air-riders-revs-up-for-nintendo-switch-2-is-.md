## Kirby Air Riders Revs Up for Nintendo Switch 2: Is It the New Mario Kart?

Get ready to race! After more than two decades, *Kirby Air Riders* is making a triumphant return, this time on the Nintendo Switch 2. Announced during a recent Nintendo Direct, the sequel to the beloved 2003 GameCube title, *Kirby Air Ride*, is set to launch on November 20th and promises a fresh take on the racing genre. But is it just another *Mario Kart* clone?

### A Familiar Face Returns

What makes this announcement even more exciting is that Masahiro Sakurai, the mastermind behind the original *Kirby Air Ride* and the *Super Smash Bros.* series, is back in the director's chair. This marks his first Kirby title directorial role since the original, adding a layer of anticipation for long-time fans. Sakurai himself jokingly acknowledged the challenges of game development, saying, “Oh dear, why is making a game so hard?”

### More Than Just a One-Button Wonder

Remember the original *Kirby Air Ride's* unique one-button control scheme? *Air Riders* expands upon this, adding a second button for even more control and strategic gameplay. According to Sakurai, “This time we’ve added a second button. Unfortunately.” This seemingly small change could have a significant impact on the game's depth and accessibility.

### A Star-Studded Roster

While the original game featured various Kirby forms, *Air Riders* boasts an expanded roster of playable characters. Fan favorites like King Dedede and Meta Knight join the fray, alongside lesser-known characters like Starman. Each character can utilize copy abilities, just like Kirby, adding a layer of strategic depth to the racing experience. Expect to see special moves that boost speed, attack opponents, or activate unique abilities like transforming into a giant snowball!

Up to eight players can compete locally, while online races can accommodate up to 16 players. This ensures plenty of opportunities for both friendly competition and intense online battles.

### City Trial: More Than Just Racing

*Air Riders* isn't just about traditional races. The City Trial mode offers a unique twist. Players must upgrade their rides by collecting power-ups, stealing new machines, and battling opponents. Random field events introduce short races and battles, challenging players to adapt and strategize on the fly. The ultimate goal? To upgrade your machine as much as possible within five minutes before entering Stadiums for the main competitions.

### A Collaboration of Titans

The game is being developed by Bandai Namco Studios and Sora LTD, the teams behind *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*. This collaboration brings together some of the industry's brightest minds, ensuring a high-quality and polished gaming experience. Notably, HAL Laboratory, the longtime Kirby developer, is not involved in this project.

### Sakurai's Return to Game Development

Sakurai's return to game development follows his successful run as a YouTuber, where he shared insights into game creation on his channel, Mashiro Sakurai on Creating Games. After wrapping up *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*, he dedicated himself to this new project, finally unveiling *Kirby Air Riders* as his next creation.

### Standing Out From the Crowd

With *Mario Kart World* already on the horizon, the Switch 2 is shaping up to be a racing fan's paradise. Sakurai himself acknowledged the similarities between the two games but emphasized that *Air Riders* offers more than just a race to the finish line. “The appeal of the game is not actually the races,” he stated, highlighting the unique modes and gameplay mechanics that set it apart.

### More to Come

Nintendo is expected to release more details about *Kirby Air Riders*, including pricing, later this year. A hands-on demo will be available at PAX West in Seattle from August 29th to September 1st. Be sure to check it out and experience the game for yourself!
