## Hadrian Secures $260M to Automate Space & Defense Manufacturing

American manufacturing is getting a major boost! Hadrian, a startup focused on automating the production of parts for the space and defense industries, has just raised a whopping $260 million in Series C funding. This substantial investment signals a growing belief in the importance of revitalizing American industry through advanced technology.

### Revolutionizing Manufacturing with Automation

Hadrian's mission is to modernize how things are made in the USA. They're using cutting-edge automation to produce high-quality parts for aerospace and defense companies, and they're doing it much faster than traditional methods. This is a big deal because the current manufacturing landscape is often characterized by smaller shops with aging equipment and workforces.

### From CNC Machining to a Full Suite of Services

Initially, Hadrian focused on high-precision CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining. This process creates parts with incredibly tight tolerances, measured in microns (millionths of a meter). To give you an idea, a human hair is about 50 to 120 microns thick!

But Hadrian isn't stopping there. According to a post by Chris Power, Hadrian is expanding into welding, casting, additive manufacturing, and other processes. This diversification will allow them to offer a more comprehensive range of services to their clients.

### Factory Expansion and New Capabilities

This new funding will fuel the construction of "Factory 3" in Arizona, scheduled to be operational by Christmas 2025. This new facility will have four times the machining capacity of Hadrian's existing second factory. Hadrian is also expanding its headquarters and R&D facility in Torrance, California.

Furthermore, Hadrian plans to offer specialized divisions for maritime and munitions-specific parts. This move aims to address the urgent need for speed and scale in reclaiming America's position as a global industrial leader.

### Factories as a Service: A New Business Model

Hadrian isn't just selling parts; they're offering a "factories as a service" model. This means they'll provide dedicated facilities for customers who want guaranteed production capacity. This innovative approach offers greater control and reliability for companies with critical manufacturing needs.

### The Urgency of Reindustrialization

Chris Power emphasized the critical importance of bringing manufacturing back to America. He argues that the country faces a significant challenge and that reindustrialization is essential for its future. He believes there's a limited window of opportunity to revitalize American industry and restore its former strength.

### Who's Investing in Hadrian?

The Series C round was led by Founders Fund and Lux Capital, with Morgan Stanley providing financing for the factory expansion. Other investors include Altimeter, 1789 Capital, a16z, Construct Capital, and 137 Ventures. Since its founding in 2020, Hadrian has raised nearly $500 million.

### The Future of Manufacturing

Hadrian's success highlights the growing interest in using automation and advanced technologies to transform manufacturing. By focusing on speed, precision, and a comprehensive suite of services, Hadrian is positioning itself as a key player in the reindustrialization of America. This investment will allow them to scale their operations, expand their capabilities, and ultimately, contribute to a stronger and more competitive American manufacturing sector.
