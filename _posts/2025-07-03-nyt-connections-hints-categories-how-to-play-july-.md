### What is NYT Connections?

*Connections* is a daily word game created by the *New York Times* where you must group 16 words into four categories of four words each. The game, designed with help from puzzle editor Wyna Liu, is available on the web and mobile devices.

The goal is simple: identify the hidden connections between the words. However, the challenge lies in the fact that some words might seem to fit into multiple categories, requiring careful consideration and a bit of lateral thinking. Players get four attempts and wrong guesses count as mistakes â€“ after four mistakes, the game ends. You can also shuffle the board to rearrange the words and help you spot connections.

The categories are color-coded by difficulty: Yellow (easiest), Green, Blue, and Purple (hardest). Once you find all four words in a set, they are removed from the board. Like *Wordle*, you can share your results on social media to compare your performance with friends.

### How to Play Connections: A Quick Guide

1.  **Start with the Obvious:** Look for words that immediately jump out as being related.
2.  **Consider Multiple Meanings:** Some words have more than one meaning. Think about all the possibilities.
3.  **Look for Categories:** Try to identify potential categories (e.g., colors, countries, types of food).
4.  **Don't Be Afraid to Shuffle:** Rearranging the board can help you see the words in a new light.
5.  **Use Your Mistakes Wisely:** Each mistake is a learning opportunity. Pay attention to which words didn't work together and adjust your strategy.
