## USAID Abandons Device Collection: Security Concerns and E-Waste Implications

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) has made a controversial decision regarding the handling of government-issued devices previously held by former employees. Reversing its previous policy, the agency, under the Trump administration, will no longer physically collect phones, laptops, and tablets from individuals who have left the organization. This shift raises significant concerns about data security, environmental responsibility, and the potential waste of valuable resources.

### The Policy Shift: Remote Wiping and Self-Disposal

According to an email obtained by *The Verge*, USAID will now remotely wipe the devices and mark them as "disposed." The responsibility for physically discarding the equipment then falls entirely on the former employees. The email does not clarify whether this policy applies to both US-based and overseas employees, leaving many questions unanswered.

This abrupt change in policy has left some former employees, who had been waiting for months to return their devices, in a state of confusion and concern. The rationale behind this decision, as stated in the email, is "to simplify processes and to reduce burden." However, the potential consequences of this policy shift may outweigh any perceived simplification.

### Security Risks and Data Protection

One of the most pressing concerns is the potential security risk. Devices held by former employees could still contain sensitive information, including personnel records, contact details, and even bank account information used for payments. Although remote wiping is intended to mitigate this risk, it's not a foolproof solution.

Even after a device is wiped, there's a possibility that data could be recovered using specialized tools. Moreover, until the devices are physically disposed of, former employees are responsible for safeguarding the data, a burden they may not be equipped or willing to bear.

As one former government official noted, remote wiping is a standard procedure for federal agencies to protect data on lost or stolen devices. However, the effectiveness of this measure depends on the thoroughness of the wiping process and the security protocols in place. In this case, the lack of clear guidelines and support for former employees raises doubts about the overall security of the process.

### E-Waste Concerns and Environmental Impact

Beyond security, the decision to have former employees dispose of the devices raises significant environmental concerns. Electronic waste, or e-waste, contains hazardous materials such as lead and mercury, which can leach into the environment if not disposed of properly. Many states, as well as Washington, D.C., have laws prohibiting the disposal of certain electronics in landfills.

One former employee described a chaotic scene at their office in late February, where computers were dumped into large garbage bins. This haphazard approach to e-waste disposal is not only environmentally irresponsible but also potentially illegal. 

By shifting the responsibility for disposal to former employees, USAID is essentially offloading the environmental burden onto individuals who may not be aware of the proper disposal methods. This could lead to a significant increase in e-waste ending up in landfills, posing a threat to public health and the environment.

### The Unusability Factor: Devices Rendered Obsolete

Another concern raised by former employees is the usability of the devices after they have been wiped. According to reports, the devices would require a new operating system to function. Furthermore, former employees would no longer be able to use their personal identification verification (PIV) cards, which are required to log into USAID computers. 

As a result, the discarded devices are essentially rendered useless. "Isn't that just such waste [sic]. They will all be unusable," a former USAID employee lamented, highlighting the potential waste of valuable resources.

### Lost Opportunities for Reuse and Redistribution

Traditionally, federal agencies reallocate returned equipment to other staff, federal agencies, or partner organizations. Devices may also be donated to state and local agencies, sold at public auctions, or sent to secure disposal facilities. 

According to the Code of Federal Regulations, equipment worth less than $10,000 can be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of by recipients with no further responsibility to the federal agency. However, the decision to abandon device collection eliminates the opportunity for USAID to reuse or redistribute these devices, potentially depriving other organizations of valuable resources.

### State Department's Silence and Lack of Transparency

The State Department, which has absorbed any remaining USAID programs, has declined to comment on the matter. This lack of transparency further fuels concerns about the decision-making process and the potential consequences of the policy shift.

The decision to no longer collect devices from former employees appears to be a cost-cutting measure disguised as a simplification of processes. However, the potential security risks, environmental concerns, and waste of resources outweigh any perceived benefits.

### Conclusion: A Short-Sighted Policy with Far-Reaching Implications

USAID's decision to abandon device collection is a short-sighted policy with potentially far-reaching implications. By shifting the responsibility for data security and e-waste disposal to former employees, the agency is not only increasing the risk of data breaches and environmental damage but also wasting valuable resources that could be reused or redistributed. 

A more responsible approach would involve implementing a secure and environmentally sound device collection and disposal program, ensuring that sensitive data is protected and that e-waste is managed in a sustainable manner. Until such a program is in place, USAID's decision will continue to raise concerns about data security, environmental responsibility, and the agency's commitment to responsible resource management.
