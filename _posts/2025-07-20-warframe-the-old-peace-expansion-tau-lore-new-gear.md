## What is "The Old Peace" All About?

"The Old Peace" is more than just another Warframe update; it's a narrative-driven experience that explores the complex history of the Orokin Empire, the Sentients, and the Tenno. It delves into a period of fragile peace in the Tau system, a region that has been shrouded in mystery for years.

The expansion focuses on:

*   **Exploring repressed memories:** The Tenno will use their void powers to uncover forgotten events and hidden truths.
*   **The Tau System:** Get a first look at this highly anticipated star system, the original destination of the Zariman Ten-Zero.
*   **The Indifference:** Prepare for the approaching war with this Eldritch threat as you uncover crucial lost knowledge.

## A Glimpse into Tau: Warframe's Promised Land

For dedicated Warframe lore enthusiasts, the chance to finally see Tau is a huge deal. Tau is the star system that the Orokin Empire aimed to colonize using the Sentients. Itâ€™s the destination the Zariman Ten-Zero was headed to before the incident that created the Tenno. This expansion will give players a tantalizing taste of what Tau holds, even though full exploration won't be available until 2026.

## The Devil's Triad: New Characters and Their Significance

"The Old Peace" introduces a fascinating group of characters known as The Devil's Triad. These Orokin enforcers are religious zealots connected to Albrecht Entrati, the scientist who first contacted the Indifference and created the Warframes. The Triad consists of:

*   **Father Lyon Allard:** A protoframe variant of Harrow.
*   **Marie Leroux:** A protoframe variant of Wisp.
*   **Uriel:** A new Warframe consumed by the Infestation's steelskin.

These characters add a darker, more gothic vibe to the Warframe universe, hinting at the complex political and spiritual landscape of the Orokin Empire. According to Warframe experts, this is Digital Extreme's way of spicing up the lore and keeping the game fresh after 10 years. 

## Caliban Prime and Enhanced Tenno Powers

The expansion also brings exciting updates to gameplay:

*   **Caliban Prime:** The next Warframe to receive the Prime treatment is Caliban, a hybrid of Infestation and Sentient technology. This makes perfect sense within the context of "The Old Peace," as Caliban embodies the alliance between the Tenno and the Sentients.
*   **Focus System Upgrades:** Players invested in the five core focus schools will gain access to powerful ultimate abilities. Digital Extremes plans to reveal more details about these upgrades in future Devstreams.

## Why This Matters: A Deeper Dive into Warframe's Lore

"The Old Peace" isn't just about new content; it's about enriching the Warframe experience by providing deeper context to the game's lore. By exploring the events that shaped the Tenno, the Orokin, and the Sentients, players will gain a better understanding of the conflicts that drive the Warframe universe. This expansion also sets the stage for future content, particularly the upcoming war with the Indifference.

**Actionable Takeaway:** Start leveling up your Focus schools now to prepare for the new ultimate abilities coming with "The Old Peace" expansion. Experiment with different schools to find the one that best suits your playstyle.
