## Brex's AI Adoption Strategy: Embracing the 'Messiness' of Innovation

Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing rapidly, and companies are struggling to keep up. Traditional software procurement processes are often too slow to effectively evaluate and implement new AI tools. Corporate credit card company Brex recognized this challenge and revamped its approach to **AI adoption**. Let's dive into how they are navigating this new landscape.

### The Problem: Slow Procurement in a Fast-Moving AI World

Imagine trying to buy a new gadget, but the entire buying process takes so long that you lose interest by the time you can finally use it. That's essentially what many companies are experiencing with **artificial intelligence**. The traditional software procurement process, which can take months, simply isn't fast enough to keep pace with the rapid evolution of AI. 

Brex CTO James Reggio highlighted this issue at the HumanX AI conference. He explained that their initial attempts to evaluate AI tools using their standard procurement strategy were failing. The lengthy piloting process meant that teams often lost interest in the tool by the time it was finally approved. This realization forced Brex to rethink its entire approach.

### Brex's Solution: A New Framework for AI Procurement

So, how did Brex overcome this hurdle? They implemented several key changes:

*   **Streamlined Legal Validations:** Brex developed a new framework for data processing agreements and legal validations specifically tailored for AI tools. This allowed them to vet potential tools much faster and get them into the hands of testers more quickly.
*   **The "Superhuman Product-Market-Fit Test":** Instead of relying solely on top-down decisions, Brex empowers its employees to play a significant role in deciding which AI tools the company should adopt. They use a "superhuman product-market-fit test" to determine which tools are truly valuable beyond the initial pilot program.
*   **Empowering Engineers with Budgets:** Brex gives its engineers a monthly budget of $50 to license software tools from an approved list. This allows them to experiment and find the tools that best optimize their workflows. Reggio noted that this decentralized approach has led to a diverse range of tool usage, validating the decision to make it easy to try different options.

### Embracing the Messiness: A Key to Success

Reggio emphasizes that the best way for companies to approach AI innovation is to "embrace the messiness." He acknowledges that figuring out which tools to adopt will be a bumpy process, and that's perfectly acceptable. The key is to avoid overthinking and lengthy evaluations that can lead to missed opportunities. According to Reggio, the biggest mistake a company can make is spending too long evaluating tools before deploying them, as the AI landscape can change dramatically in a short period.

### The Results: Agility and Informed Decisions

Brex's new approach has yielded positive results. By empowering employees, streamlining legal processes, and embracing experimentation, they have become more agile in adopting and integrating **AI tools**. They are also able to make more informed decisions about which tools require broader licensing deals based on actual usage data.

### Actionable Takeaway: Empower Your Employees

One of the most valuable lessons from Brex's experience is the importance of empowering employees to experiment with AI tools. Give them the freedom and resources to explore different options and find what works best for their individual workflows. This can lead to unexpected discoveries and ultimately drive greater **enterprise** innovation.

### Why This Matters

In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, companies need to be agile and adaptable. Brex's story demonstrates that traditional approaches to software procurement may not be suitable for the fast-paced world of AI. By embracing experimentation, empowering employees, and streamlining processes, companies can unlock the full potential of **artificial intelligence** and stay ahead of the curve.

### FAQ

**Q: What is Brex's "superhuman product-market-fit test"?**
A: It's an approach where Brex deeply engages with the employees who are finding the most value from a particular AI tool to determine if it's truly unique and worth investing in beyond the pilot program.

**Q: Why is it important to "embrace the messiness" when adopting AI?**
A: Because the AI landscape is constantly changing, and companies shouldn't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes along the way. Overthinking and lengthy evaluations can lead to missed opportunities.

**Q: How does Brex decide which AI tools to invest in long-term?**
A: They analyze usage data and feedback from employees to determine which tools are providing the most value and have the greatest potential for long-term impact.

### Key Takeaways

*   Traditional software procurement processes are often too slow for AI **adoption**.
*   Brex revamped its approach by streamlining legal validations and empowering employees.
*   The company uses a "superhuman product-market-fit test" to evaluate AI tools.
*   Embracing experimentation and avoiding overthinking are crucial for success.
*   Empowering employees can lead to greater innovation and more informed decisions.

This approach allows **startups**, and larger companies, to keep up with the latest trends in AI and ensure they're leveraging the best tools available.
