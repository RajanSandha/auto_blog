## How Does Prime Day Work?

On Prime Day, Amazon Prime subscribers can visit the Amazon website or app to view all of the exclusive deals available to them. The discounts will automatically be applied to your cart. If you are not a Prime subscriber, you will still be able to see the deals, but they will be marked as "Prime exclusive" and will not be available to you.

## Is Prime Day Only For Prime Members?

While the vast majority of deals are exclusive to Prime members, Amazon usually offers a small selection of deals that are available to all shoppers. It's worth checking the site even if you don't have a Prime membership. Keep an eye out for items that are not marked as "Prime exclusive."

Also, don't forget to check out other retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy during Prime Day. They often offer competing sales that don't require a membership.

## Actionable Takeaway

**Start making a list now!** Identify the tech gadgets or software you've been wanting, and check their prices regularly leading up to Prime Day. This will help you quickly recognize a truly great deal and avoid impulse purchases you might regret.
