### What is NYT Connections?

*Connections* is a word association game created by the *New York Times*. Wyna Liu, an associate puzzle editor, is credited with its creation. The game presents you with 16 words, and your mission is to group them into four categories of four words each. Each group of words shares a common link. Sounds easy, right? Sometimes it is, but often it requires some serious brainpower!

You can play *Connections* on your web browser or mobile device. The game resets daily, bringing a fresh set of words and challenges. The categories can range from anything like book titles or software to types of food, or even different countries. The trick is that some words might *seem* to fit into multiple categories, but there's only one correct solution.

Each incorrect guess counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. Don't be afraid to shuffle the board to get a fresh perspective. The categories are also color-coded by difficulty: Yellow (easiest), Green, Blue, and Purple (hardest).
