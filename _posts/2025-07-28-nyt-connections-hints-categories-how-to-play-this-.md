*Connections* is a word association game where you need to group four words that share a connection. It's like a puzzle, a riddle, and a vocabulary test all rolled into one! Let's dive into how to play and how to win.

## What is NYT Connections?

*Connections* is the *New York Times*' popular daily word game that challenges players to find the hidden links between words. Created with the help of puzzle editor Wyna Liu, it's become a social media phenomenon. You can play *Connections* on your web browser or mobile device.

The game presents you with 16 words, and your task is to group them into four categories of four words each. These categories can be anything – from types of movies to synonyms for a word. While some words might seem to fit into multiple categories, there's only one correct solution. Choose wisely!

### How to Play

1.  **Start with the Obvious:** Look for words that clearly go together. These are usually the easiest categories to identify.
2.  **Rearrange the Board:** Use the shuffle button to mix up the words. This can help you see connections you might have missed.
3.  **Pay Attention to Color Coding:** Each category has a difficulty level, indicated by color: Yellow (easiest), Green, Blue, and Purple (hardest).
4.  **Don't Be Afraid to Guess:** You have four mistakes before the game ends, so don't be afraid to take a calculated risk. However, try to only guess when you have a strong feeling about a connection.
5.  **Share Your Results:** Once you've solved the puzzle (or run out of guesses), you can share your results with friends on social media.

## Tips and Strategies for Solving Connections

*   **Look for Synonyms:** Sometimes the connection is simply that the words are synonyms or related terms.
*   **Think Outside the Box:** The connections aren't always obvious. Try to think creatively and consider different possibilities.
*   **Consider Multiple Meanings:** Some words have multiple meanings. Think about all the possible interpretations.
*   **Use the Process of Elimination:** If you're stuck, try to eliminate words that you know don't belong in a particular category.
*   **Focus on One Category at a Time:** Instead of trying to solve the whole puzzle at once, focus on finding one category first.
