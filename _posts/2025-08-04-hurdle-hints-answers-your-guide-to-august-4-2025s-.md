## What is Hurdle?

Hurdle presents a unique twist on the word game format. Here's how it works:

*   **Five Rounds:** The game consists of five word puzzles.
*   **Guessing Game:** The first round is a standard word-guessing game. You'll receive feedback on correct, misplaced, and incorrect letters with each guess.
*   **Chain Reaction:** Correctly guessing a word unlocks the next hurdle. The answer from the previous hurdle becomes your first guess in the subsequent round.
*   **Clue System:** Using the previous answer as your first guess in the next round offers clues, but the number of highlighted letters doesn't necessarily reflect the final hurdle's letter count.

## Tips and Tricks for Playing Hurdle

Want to improve your Hurdle game? Here are a few strategies to keep in mind:

*   **Start with Common Letters:** Begin with words containing common vowels and consonants (e.g., ADIEU, AUDIO, OUIJA) to quickly eliminate possibilities.
*   **Pay Attention to Letter Placement:** Carefully analyze the highlighted letters. Green indicates a correct letter in the correct spot, while yellow signifies a correct letter in the wrong spot.
*   **Consider Letter Frequency:** Remember that the number of times a letter is highlighted in previous guesses doesn't necessarily indicate its frequency in the final hurdle. 
*   **Use a Word List:** Keep a mental (or physical) list of possible words based on the clues you've gathered. This helps you narrow down the options and avoid repeating incorrect guesses.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Experiment:** If you're stuck, try a word that you know is *incorrect* to eliminate certain letters. This can be a valuable strategy for uncovering the correct answer. 

## Actionable Takeaway

Try using a process of elimination. Start with common letters, analyze the letter placement hints, and don't be afraid to experiment with different words to narrow down the possibilities. Keep a mental note (or a physical one) of the letters you've tried and their positions to avoid repeating mistakes.
