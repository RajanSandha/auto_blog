### What Makes Strands Unique?

Strands isn't your average word search. Here's what sets it apart:

*   **Interconnected Letters:** Words can be formed by linking letters up, down, left, right, or diagonally. Get ready to think outside the box!
*   **Direction Changes:** Words can change direction, creating unique and unexpected shapes.
*   **Every Letter Counts:** Every single letter in the grid is part of an answer. No letter is left behind!
*   **Thematic Connection:** All the hidden words are related to a central theme.
*   **The Spangram:** The "spangram" is a special word or phrase that sums up the day's theme and stretches across the entire grid horizontally or vertically. Finding the spangram is key to unlocking the puzzle.

### Why Strands Can Be Tricky

Unlike some other word games, Strands deliberately provides opaque hints and doesn't give you a word list. This makes it a brain-teasing game that can take a bit longer to solve than games like Wordle or Connections. If you're short on time or just need a little help, our hints are here to guide you.
