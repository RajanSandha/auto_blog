## Resident Evil Requiem: A New Chapter Unfolds, But Where's Leon Kennedy?

The gaming world is buzzing! After a tantalizing tease at Summer Game Fest, Capcom officially unveiled *Resident Evil Requiem*, also known as *Resident Evil 9*. This marks the first mainline entry since the critically acclaimed *Resident Evil Village* in 2021.  But amidst the excitement, a key question lingers in the air: Where's Leon Kennedy?

Let's dive into everything we know so far about this highly anticipated survival horror game and explore the clues, characters, and possible storylines that await us. We'll also address the elephant in the room – or rather, the missing S.T.A.R.S. member – Leon S. Kennedy.

## Unveiling Resident Evil Requiem: A Return to Roots?

The initial trailer for *Resident Evil Requiem* introduces us to Grace Ashcroft, an FBI agent with intriguing ties to the infamous Raccoon City. For die-hard *Resident Evil* fans, the name Ashcroft will undoubtedly ring a bell. Grace is the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a survivor from the online-only title, *Resident Evil Outbreak* for the PS2. Alyssa, a journalist caught in the Raccoon City nightmare during the events of *Resident Evil 2*, fought alongside other survivors to escape the city's impending doom.

In the trailer, Grace visits the Remwood Hotel, the very location where her mother, Alyssa, met her untimely demise.  Furthermore, the trailer showcases haunting images that appear to be the remnants of a devastated Raccoon City, including the iconic police department from *Resident Evil 2*. This suggests that *Resident Evil Requiem* might be a chilling return to the series' origins, delving deeper into the unresolved horrors of Raccoon City.

### The Ashcroft Legacy: Connecting the Past to the Present

Grace Ashcroft's presence immediately raises questions about her role in the overarching narrative. Is she seeking revenge for her mother's death? Is she investigating a new threat that has emerged from the ashes of Raccoon City? Her connection to Alyssa Ashcroft adds a layer of intrigue and emotional depth to the story, potentially offering a fresh perspective on the events that shaped the *Resident Evil* universe. This new character may even give us a greater understanding of the Umbrella Corporation.

## The Mystery of Leon Kennedy: A Notable Absence

Now, let's address the burning question: Where is Leon Kennedy? Rumors have been swirling for months about Leon's potential return in *Resident Evil 9*. He's a fan-favorite character whose presence has often elevated the series to new heights. His absence in the initial trailer is certainly conspicuous, leaving many fans wondering if he'll make an appearance later in the game or if he's been completely excluded from this installment.

### Leon's Impact on the Resident Evil Franchise

Leon Kennedy's journey in the *Resident Evil* universe is nothing short of iconic. He first burst onto the scene as a rookie cop in *Resident Evil 2*, instantly captivating players with his bravery, resourcefulness, and unwavering determination. His role in *Resident Evil 4* further cemented his status as a franchise staple, as he navigated a terrifying new threat with his signature blend of wit and combat prowess. He even appeared as a playable character in *Resident Evil 6*, a game that, while divisive, showcased his continued importance to the series. The *Resident Evil* community is always excited when he appears.

### Will Leon Appear in Resident Evil Requiem?

While his absence from the trailer is disheartening for some, it's important to remember that this is just the first glimpse into *Resident Evil Requiem*. It's entirely possible that Leon's role is being kept under wraps to preserve a major plot twist or surprise reveal. Perhaps he'll appear as a supporting character, providing guidance and assistance to Grace Ashcroft. Or maybe he'll emerge as a playable protagonist later in the game, offering a different perspective on the unfolding events. Only time will tell if Leon S. Kennedy will make his triumphant return in *Resident Evil Requiem*.

## Resident Evil's Evolution: From Classic Horror to Modern Thrills

*Resident Evil* has undergone a remarkable evolution throughout its history, constantly reinventing itself while staying true to its core survival horror roots. The original *Resident Evil* set the stage with its claustrophobic environments, limited resources, and terrifying creatures. *Resident Evil 2* built upon this foundation with a more expansive story, improved gameplay mechanics, and a greater emphasis on character development. And *Resident Evil 4* revolutionized the series with its over-the-shoulder perspective, action-oriented combat, and unforgettable setting.

### Remakes: Breathing New Life into Beloved Classics

In recent years, Capcom has successfully revitalized the *Resident Evil* franchise with a series of critically acclaimed remakes. The *Resident Evil 2* remake (2019) delivered a stunning visual overhaul, modernized gameplay, and a faithful recreation of the original's story and atmosphere. The *Resident Evil 4* remake followed suit, offering a similar level of polish and refinement. These remakes have not only introduced a new generation of players to the *Resident Evil* universe but have also reignited the passion of longtime fans.

## Looking Ahead: Resident Evil Requiem's Potential

*Resident Evil Requiem* has the potential to be a truly special entry in the series. By returning to the familiar setting of Raccoon City and introducing new characters with compelling backstories, Capcom has created a foundation for a gripping and emotionally resonant narrative. The game's release date is set for February 27, 2026, for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series consoles, but we're hoping to get our hands on it sooner. 

### Getting Ready for the Return to Raccoon City

If you're eager to prepare for the release of *Resident Evil Requiem*, now is the perfect time to revisit some of the classic *Resident Evil* games. Capcom is currently having a sale that includes virtually all of the titles, including *Village* and the three remakes. Immerse yourself in the world of *Resident Evil* and get ready for the next chapter in this iconic survival horror franchise. .

## Resident Evil Requiem: A New Beginning or a Return to the Past?

*Resident Evil Requiem* promises to be a thrilling and unforgettable experience for fans of the series. Whether it's a new beginning or a return to the past, one thing is certain: the horrors of Raccoon City are far from over. Keep an eye out for more information and updates as we approach the game's release date. And who knows, maybe Leon Kennedy will surprise us all with a grand entrance!
