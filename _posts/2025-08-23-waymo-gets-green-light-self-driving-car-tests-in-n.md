## Waymo Takes on the Big Apple: Self-Driving Car Tests Approved in NYC

Get ready, New York! Self-driving cars are officially hitting the streets, thanks to a new permit granted to Waymo. Mayor Eric Adams recently announced that Waymo can now test its autonomous vehicles (AVs) in select areas of Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn.

This marks a significant milestone as the first permit of its kind issued by the city for "testing deployment" of autonomous vehicles. Waymo will be allowed to operate a fleet of up to eight vehicles until late September 2025. However, there's a catch: for now, all tests must be conducted with a human driver behind the wheel.

### Waymo's Expansion Plans

Waymo has been eyeing New York City for some time. Earlier this year, they announced plans to test their **driverless system** in ten new cities throughout 2025. The application to test in NYC was filed in June, signaling their ambition to eventually launch their autonomous ride-hailing service in the city that never sleeps. It's worth noting that Waymo vehicles were previously deployed in NYC back in 2021 for mapping purposes.

### Data Reporting and Cybersecurity

The permit comes with specific requirements. Waymo must regularly report data gathered from its testing to the Department of Transportation. This is to ensure they are adhering to the industryâ€™s best practices related to **cybersecurity**. This rigorous oversight is crucial for building public trust and ensuring the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles.

After the initial testing period ends in September 2025, Waymo can apply for an extension. However, the requirement for human operators may remain in place for a while. New York state law currently prohibits the operation of vehicles without a driver behind the wheel.

Waymo is actively lobbying to change this regulation, according to Forbes. The company aims to eventually operate fully **autonomous vehicles** in New York City, but legislative hurdles need to be overcome first.

### The Future of Self-Driving Cars in NYC

This pilot program represents a significant step forward for **autonomous vehicle** technology in a complex urban environment. New York City presents unique challenges, including dense traffic, unpredictable pedestrian behavior, and challenging weather conditions. Testing in this environment will provide valuable data and insights for Waymo and the broader **self-driving car** industry.

It remains to be seen when fully driverless Waymo vehicles will become a reality in New York City. However, this permit marks a crucial first step towards that future.

**Actionable Takeaway:**

Keep an eye out for Waymo vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. While you won't be able to hail a ride just yet, observing these tests in action can give you a glimpse into the future of transportation.
