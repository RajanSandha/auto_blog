Looking for a way to unwind this weekend? If you're a fan of **horror** and suspense, then grab a blanket, dim the lights, and dive into these thrilling reads. This week, we're spotlighting a double dose of terror from Stephen Graham Jones and a gritty comic book miniseries set in the Louisiana bayou.

## Double the Terror: Stephen Graham Jones' Saga Doubles

Stephen Graham Jones is known for his ability to blend classic horror tropes with fresh, unexpected twists. The Saga Doubles release of *Killer on the Road* and *The Babysitter Lives* offers a one-two punch of chilling narratives.

### *Killer on the Road*: A Highway to Hell

*Killer on the Road* throws you headfirst into a brutal world of hitchhiker-targeting serial killers. The story follows a runaway teen and her friends who find themselves in the crosshairs of a relentless predator. Jones's writing is gripping, gory, and surprisingly humorous, creating a reading experience that's both terrifying and entertaining. The "Chapter 0" cold open immediately sets a tone of unrelenting dread, letting you know exactly what kind of ride you're in for.

### *The Babysitter Lives*: A Night of Supernatural Horror

Previously available as an audiobook, *The Babysitter Lives* plunges you into a night of babysitting gone horribly wrong. Set on Halloween night, the story unfolds in a house where something is definitely not right. Jones masterfully builds suspense, delivering genuine scares that will keep you up way past your bedtime.

Both stories are fun to read and will keep you on the edge of your seat.

## Into the Bayou: *The Voice Said Kill* #1

For comic book fans, *The Voice Said Kill* #1 offers a different kind of thrill. Described as "*Fargo* meets *Deliverance* in a sweaty swamp-thriller," this Image Comics miniseries is set in the atmospheric Louisiana bayou.

### A Pregnant Park Ranger's Nightmare

The story follows Marie, a pregnant park ranger who stumbles into serious trouble with a crime ring. While the plot is compelling, the artwork by Vanesa R. Del Rey truly elevates the comic. Her gritty and evocative style perfectly captures the oppressive atmosphere of the bayou, drawing you into Marie's desperate situation.

With two issues already released, *The Voice Said Kill* promises a wild and unpredictable ride.

## Why These Reads Stand Out

These books aren't just your average horror stories. They offer something more:

*   **Unique Twists:** Stephen Graham Jones takes familiar horror themes and spins them into something new and unsettling.
*   **Atmospheric Settings:** From the open road to the Louisiana bayou, these stories transport you to vividly realized and terrifying landscapes.
*   **Compelling Characters:** You'll find yourself invested in the fates of these characters, even as they face unimaginable horrors.
