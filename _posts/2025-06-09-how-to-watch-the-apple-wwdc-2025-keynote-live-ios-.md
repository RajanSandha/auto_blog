It's that time of year again, Apple enthusiasts! The **Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)** is here, and the keynote is about to kick off. If you're eager to see what Apple has in store for the future of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and all their platforms, you're in the right place. This guide will tell you **how to watch the WWDC keynote live** and what exciting announcements to expect.

### Why WWDC Matters

Apple's WWDC is more than just a conference; it's a glimpse into the future of Apple's ecosystem. This is where Apple unveils the new features and updates that will shape how we use our iPhones, iPads, Macs, and more in the coming year. From groundbreaking software updates to innovative hardware integrations, WWDC is where it all begins.

This year, all eyes are on **Apple Intelligence**, Apple's AI initiative. After a somewhat lukewarm reception and recent delays, the pressure is on for Apple to showcase its AI vision. But that's not all! Rumors are swirling about a major OS redesign and potential new hardware.

### Beyond the Keynote: Developer Sessions

After the keynote, Apple will host online developer sessions. These sessions provide in-depth, technical overviews of the new software features. If you're a developer, these sessions are invaluable for understanding how to leverage the latest Apple technologies in your apps.

## What to Expect: Rumors and Predictions

So, what can we expect from WWDC 2025? Here's a rundown of the most exciting rumors and predictions:

### 1. A Major OS Redesign: "Liquid Glass" Interface

One of the biggest rumors is that Apple is planning a complete redesign of its operating systems. This redesign, reportedly codenamed "Liquid Glass," aims to make the OS more cohesive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. Expect "see-through visuals" and a more immersive experience, potentially inspired by visionOS.

### 2. iPadOS Evolution: More Mac-Like Features

The iPad could be getting a significant upgrade with new multitasking and window management features. Apple seems to be aiming to make the iPad more like a Mac, blurring the lines between tablet and desktop computing. This could include more flexible windowing options, improved keyboard shortcuts, and enhanced file management.

### 3. Apple Intelligence: A Second Chance

**Apple Intelligence** is undoubtedly a key focus. After a somewhat underwhelming initial rollout, Apple needs to demonstrate the value of its AI initiatives. Expect to see improvements to Siri, enhanced AI-powered features in apps like Photos and Messages, and potentially new AI-driven services.

### 4. New Battery Management Features

Rumors suggest that iOS 26 will include AI-powered battery management features. These features could intelligently optimize battery usage based on your usage patterns, extending battery life and reducing the need for frequent charging.

### 5. "Virtual Health Coach"

Apple is reportedly developing a revamped Health app with a built-in "virtual health coach." This feature could provide personalized health advice, track your fitness progress, and offer insights into your overall well-being. This aligns with Apple's increasing focus on health and wellness.

### 6. iOS 26 (Not iOS 19?)

Instead of the expected iOS 19, Apple might rename its operating systems to align with the year. This means we could see **iOS 26**, macOS 16, and so on. This would create a more unified naming convention across Apple's various platforms.

## Deciphering the "Sleek Peek" Tagline

Apple's WWDC poster features the tagline "Sleek Peek." While these taglines are often cryptic, they can offer hints about the event's focus. In the past, WWDC taglines have been vaguely related to the announcements. For example, last year's iPhone event tagline, "It's Glowtime," hinted at the glowing edges of the new Siri interface (which was first unveiled at WWDC 2024). While the connection wasn't immediately obvious, it did tie into the overall theme of the event. Perhaps "Sleek Peek" hints at the "Liquid Glass" interface or other visual refinements coming to Apple's operating systems.
