## Blood Moon Rising: Catch the September 2025 Lunar Eclipse!

Get ready for a celestial spectacle! September 2025 brings a full moon that's extra special: a total lunar eclipse, also known as a blood moon. While viewers in the US might miss the main event, the moon will still appear redder than usual, offering a unique viewing experience.

### What is a Blood Moon?

A blood moon happens during a total **lunar eclipse**. This is when the Earth positions itself directly between the sun and the moon. The Earth blocks most of the sun's light, but some light still manages to reach the moon after passing through Earth's atmosphere.

Our atmosphere filters out the blue light, leaving mostly red light to hit the moon. This gives the moon that characteristic reddish glow we call a "blood moon." Think of it like a sunset, where the same effect makes the sky appear red.

### Where and When to See It

The total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025, will be primarily visible in Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, and Eastern Africa. Most of the rest of Europe and Africa will see a partial eclipse. Unfortunately, North and South America are out of luck this time.

According to The Old Farmer's Almanac, the full moon, also known as the corn moon, will reach peak brightness around 2:09 p.m. ET on September 7. Since that's during the day in the US, the best time to view the corn moon will be at night on September 6 or 7. The moon will appear almost full for a few days before and after September 7, giving you multiple chances to see it. Check your local listings for the best viewing times in your area.

### Why the US Misses Out (This Time)

The Earth is round, and the eclipse happens when the moon passes through the Earth's shadow. Because of the Earth's rotation, different parts of the world face the moon at different times. So, while Asia and Australia are perfectly positioned to see the total eclipse, the US will be on the other side of the planet.

### How Rare are Lunar Eclipses?

Total lunar eclipses are less common than partial eclipses. The Earth and moon have very stable orbits, so we can predict them with great accuracy. The last lunar eclipse occurred in March 2025, and the one before that was in November 2022.

### The Future of Lunar Eclipses

The next total eclipse is due in March 2026, but it will primarily occur over the Atlantic Ocean, so it won't be widely visible. After that, we have eclipses on New Year's Eve in 2028, June 2029, December 2029, and two in 2032. Only the one in 2029 will be easily visible in the US.

### Can't See It? Livestream It!

Even if you can't see the eclipse in person, you can still experience it online! Many websites will be livestreaming the event. Check out Time and Date, FOX Weather, and the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. According to Time and Date, the eclipse should last about an hour and 22 minutes, starting around 15:28 UTC, or 11:28 a.m. ET on September 7. Grab your coffee and enjoy the show!

### Actionable Takeaway: Plan Your Viewing

Even if you're not in the path of totality for the **total lunar eclipse**, you can still see a slightly redder-than-usual full moon. Mark your calendar for the nights of September 6th and 7th, 2025. Find a spot with a clear view of the sky, away from city lights. And don't forget to check out the livestreams if the weather doesn't cooperate or if you're not in a good viewing location.

### Expert Insight (Simulated)

"Lunar eclipses are a fantastic reminder of the dynamic interplay between the Earth, the moon, and the sun," says Dr. Aris Thorne, a simulated astrophysicist. "They offer a unique opportunity to observe the effects of our atmosphere on light, and they're a beautiful sight to behold."
