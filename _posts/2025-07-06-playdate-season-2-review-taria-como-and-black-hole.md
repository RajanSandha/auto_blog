# Playdate Season 2 Review: Emotional Platformers & Black Hole Blasting

Playdate's second season has officially wrapped up, leaving a memorable mark with its unique, weekly game releases. Despite featuring fewer titles than Season One, Season Two delivered a stronger overall experience, creating a shared experience for Playdate owners. According to Panic, the team behind Playdate, Season Two has sold 12,000 units.

The season concludes with two standout titles: *Taria & Como* and *Black Hole Havoc*. Let's dive into what makes these games special.

## Taria & Como: A Touching Tale of Family and Resilience

*Taria & Como* is a physics-based platformer with a deeply emotional core. It tells the story of Taria, a girl whose parents are kidnapped by the oppressive Toxtum Inc. After a disaster, Taria wakes up to find her sister, Como, missing and her mobility aids altered to restrict her freedom. Her quest to find Como forms the heart of the game.

### Gameplay and Mechanics

Since Taria can't jump after the disaster, the game focuses on swinging mechanics. Players use the Playdate's crank to aim a tether attached to a health robot, allowing Taria to swing across gaps and navigate obstacles. This requires careful planning and adds a unique layer of challenge to the platforming.

As you progress, you'll find diary entries and files, accessible through quirky minigames featuring a dancing turtle. These files offer insights into the story and allow you to subvert the restrictive programming of Taria's healthbot.

### Themes and Commentary

*Taria & Como* touches upon themes of healthcare access and systemic failures, resonating with players who have experienced similar struggles. The game's narrative is both moving and thought-provoking.

### Minor Drawbacks

Some players might experience occasional lag between chapter changes or issues with the crank's responsiveness when trying to survey the environment. However, these issues don't significantly detract from the overall experience.

## Black Hole Havoc: Addictive Puzzle Action

On the other end of the spectrum, *Black Hole Havoc* offers a fast-paced, addictive action-puzzle experience. The premise is simple: black holes are threatening civilization, and you must stop them by firing your own black holes to cancel them out.

### Gameplay and Mechanics

Using the D-pad to aim and the crank (or A/B buttons) to adjust the size of your black holes, you must strategically eliminate the incoming threats. The game starts with aim assist, but quickly ramps up the difficulty, introducing obstacles like space tourists, collapsing ceilings, and bouncing ice blocks.

### Story and Arcade Modes

*Black Hole Havoc* features a Story Mode with 80 levels and charming cutscenes. For those who prefer a more immediate challenge, the Arcade Mode offers endless black hole blasting action and a chance to climb the leaderboards.

### Addictive Fun

With its engaging gameplay, vibrant art style, and catchy music, *Black Hole Havoc* is a highly addictive and enjoyable experience.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Unique Gameplay:** Both games utilize the Playdate's crank in innovative ways. *Taria & Como* uses it for swinging and puzzle-solving, while *Black Hole Havoc* uses it for aiming and adjusting black hole size.
*   **Emotional Depth vs. Addictive Fun:** *Taria & Como* offers a touching narrative and social commentary, while *Black Hole Havoc* provides fast-paced, addictive puzzle action.
*   **Strong Season Finale:** Both games are excellent additions to the Playdate library and represent a strong finish to Season Two.
