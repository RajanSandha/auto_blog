## Jeh Aerospace Secures $11M to Revolutionize Aircraft Supply Chain

The global aerospace industry is facing a significant challenge: a growing supply chain bottleneck. As air travel rebounds and airlines expand their fleets, the demand for aircraft components is soaring. However, traditional manufacturing processes are struggling to keep pace, leading to delays and increased costs. Enter Jeh Aerospace, an Indian startup that's aiming to solve this problem with a fresh injection of $11 million in Series A funding.

### What is Jeh Aerospace?

Jeh Aerospace, founded by former Tata Group executives Vishal Sanghavi and Venkatesh Mudragalla, is focused on scaling the production of metallic components for aero engines and aerostructures. They're not working directly with giants like Airbus or Boeing, but instead targeting Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers who make up a significant portion (60-70%) of aircraft manufacturing. Their goal is to transform India into a global hub for aerospace component manufacturing.

### Addressing the Bottleneck

The commercial aircraft industry is experiencing significant delays. According to McKinsey, the commercial aircraft backlog is near a record of almost 15,700 units. Jeh Aerospace believes that technology can alleviate this bottleneck by scaling up the production of essential metallic components. Their 60,000-square-foot facility in Hyderabad, India, utilizes precision machinery, robotics, and IoT devices to drastically reduce product introduction lead times. They've managed to shrink the industry's typical 15-week timeline to just 15 days!

### How They Do It: Software-Defined Manufacturing

Jeh Aerospace's secret weapon is its software-defined manufacturing approach. This allows for predictable and dynamic scheduling, ensuring a consistent supply of high-quality components to their customers. According to Jeh Aerospace CEO Vishal Sanghavi, this approach allows for no compromises on quality.

### The Funding Round

The $11 million Series A round was led by Elevation Capital, with participation from General Catalyst. This brings Jeh Aerospace's total funding from institutional venture capital firms to approximately $15 million. Prior to this, they also received an undisclosed strategic investment from IndiGo Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of Indian carrier IndiGo.

Ashray Iyengar, Principal at Elevation Capital, said that Jeh Aerospace has “built a truly differentiated approach to aerospace manufacturing.”

### Key Partnerships and Customers

Jeh Aerospace is strategically focusing on building strong relationships with fewer, but larger, customers. They currently have half a dozen paying customers, including GS Precision (Vermont) and RH Aero (Ohio). These are "high dollar, high ARR customers" with the potential for significant growth.

### Expert Advice

Jeh Aerospace has assembled an impressive advisory team that includes former Boeing India President Pratyush (Prat) Kumar and former Airbus India CEO and Managing Director Dwaraka Srinivasan. Their expertise provides invaluable guidance as the company navigates the complexities of the aerospace industry.

### Impressive Growth

Since its $2.75 million seed round in January of last year, Jeh Aerospace has achieved significant milestones:

*   Delivered over 100,000 flight-critical components and tools on time.
*   Established a machine capacity exceeding 250,000 hours annually.
*   Reached $6 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) in the last fiscal year.
*   Achieved profitability after taxes.

Sanghavi projects a 3x to 4x increase in ARR in the current fiscal year. 

### The Future of Aerospace Manufacturing
