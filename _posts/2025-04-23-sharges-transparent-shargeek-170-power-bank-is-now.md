  "title": "Shargeek 170 Power Bank: Transparent Tech and a $99 Deal!",
  "content": "## Shargeek 170 Power Bank: See-Through Style Meets Powerful Performance\n\nThere's something undeniably cool about tech that lets you peek behind the curtain. We all know gadgets are filled with intricate circuits and components, but they're usually hidden away, safe from prying eyes (and warranty-voiding attempts). If you share this fascination, you'll likely be captivated by Sharge's lineup of charging solutions, and right now, the **Shargeek 170 Power Bank** is available for a steal!\n\nFor a limited time, you can snag the Shargeek 170 from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SHARGEEK-Portable-Charger-Display-Waterproof/dp/B0D2VWVPRX/ref=sr_1_1) (for Prime members) and [Sharge](https://sharge.com/products/shargeek-170/) for just $99. That's a whopping $100 off the regular price! But the Shargeek 170 is more than just a pretty face; it packs serious power and functionality under its transparent shell.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/scharge2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"Shargeek 170 Power Bank\" /></center>\n\n### Power and Performance\n\nThe Shargeek 170 boasts a massive 24,000mAh battery, ensuring you can keep your devices charged on the go for extended periods. With a maximum output of 170W, this power bank can handle even power-hungry laptops and tablets.  It features two 140W USB-C ports and a single USB-A port, allowing you to charge up to three devices simultaneously.  No more fighting over outlets!\n\nBut the clever design doesn't stop there. A smart display provides real-time information on recharging time, battery percentage, and the current input and output wattage. You'll always know exactly how much power you have and how quickly your devices are charging. As *The Verge*'s Sean Hollister noted after seeing it at CES, it looks "pretty sweet," and we couldn't agree more.\n\n### Beyond the Shargeek: More Deals to Explore\n\nBut the deal-hunting doesn't stop with the Shargeek 170.
