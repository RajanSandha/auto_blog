### The Alleged Carjacking

According to a police report obtained by WIRED, the incident occurred in the early hours of August 3rd in the Logan Circle area. The report describes it as a carjacking involving Coristine and Emily Bryant, identified as his "significant other." Police claim that a group of approximately 10 juveniles surrounded their vehicle. Coristine reportedly pushed Bryant into the car before confronting the suspects, who then allegedly assaulted him.

Two individuals were arrested and charged with unarmed carjacking. However, a Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson could not confirm whether the alleged perpetrators were gang members.

### Trump and Musk's Involvement

The situation escalated when Donald Trump shared a photo of a bloodied Coristine on Truth Social, citing claims of gang violence. Elon Musk also tweeted about the incident, stating that a DOGE staffer had been "beaten to the point of concussion."

### Coristine's Background: More Than Just a DOGE Staffer

Edward Coristine's background is quite interesting. Before joining DOGE, he worked at Neuralink and started a company called Tesla.Sexy LLC. He was also briefly associated with Path Network, a company founded by individuals with a history in blackhat hacking. Furthermore, he has been linked to several government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security.

Interestingly, despite initial reports of his resignation from DOGE, Coristine was later reassigned to the Social Security Administration (SSA). However, a source at SSA told WIRED that Coristine hasn't been seen at SSA headquarters recently.

### What is DOGE?

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) appears to be a somewhat obscure entity. Details about its exact purpose and operations are scarce, adding to the intrigue surrounding this incident. The involvement of individuals with diverse backgrounds, from Neuralink to blackhat hacking, raises questions about the organization's goals and oversight.
