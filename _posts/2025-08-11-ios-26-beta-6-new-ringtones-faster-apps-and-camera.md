## iOS 26 Beta 6: What's New in Apple's Latest Update?

Apple just dropped iOS 26 beta 6, and it's packed with some interesting tweaks and improvements as we get closer to the official public release in September. While the big, groundbreaking changes might be behind us, this beta offers a glimpse at the refinements Apple is making to its mobile operating system. Let's dive into what's new!

### New Ringtones: A Surprising Addition

One of the most unexpected additions in iOS 26 beta 6 is a fresh set of ringtones. Six new ringtones, all variations of the existing "reflection" tune, have been added. The "Dreamer" ringtone, in particular, is getting a lot of buzz online. Some users are even saying it's good enough to make them take their phones off silent mode! Who knew ringtones could be so exciting?

*   **Key Takeaway:** Sometimes, the smallest changes can have the biggest impact.

### Camera App: Apple Listens to User Feedback

Remember the controversy surrounding the Camera app's swipe direction? Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responded to touch in previous betas, and users weren't happy. They complained that it messed with their muscle memory. In beta 5, Apple added a toggle to revert to the "Classic Mode." But now, in beta 6, Apple has completely removed the toggle and reverted the scroll direction back to the original way. It seems Apple decided this wasn't a battle worth fighting, showing they value user feedback.

### Snappier App Launches and New Animations

This beta isn't just about ringtones and camera tweaks. Users are reporting faster app launches and smoother transitions. Apple has also introduced new open and close animations for launching apps. These animations are similar to the ones on iPadOS, giving a slight "magic lamp" effect.

Most importantly, they’ve changed the app open/close animations to the iPadOS versions, which have a slight “magic lamp/genie”-like effect to them. <a href="https://t.co/tkiInqR8MJ">pic.twitter.com/tkiInqR8MJ</a></p>&mdash; xezrunner (@xezrunner) <a href="https://twitter.com/xezrunner/status/1724111756663910405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

### Liquid Glass: A Refined User Interface

Liquid Glass, the updated user interface for Apple devices, continues to evolve. In iOS 26 beta 6, Apple has tweaked Liquid Glass for better readability and more "glassiness." There's increased color dispersion when moving between app tabs, and the Lock Screen and toggles now feature Liquid Glass effects.

### New Onboarding Experience

After updating to iOS 26 beta 6, users will encounter a new startup/onboarding experience. This onboarding is designed to showcase Liquid Glass and other iOS 26 features, such as the dark and clear icons and redesigned interfaces.

### Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements

As with any beta release, expect bug fixes. While new issues might pop up, users are reporting that iOS 26 beta 6 feels more stable and faster than previous betas. This suggests that Apple is getting closer to the final public release.

### Public Beta Release

Now that the developer beta is out, public beta testers can expect an update soon. Keep an eye out for it!
