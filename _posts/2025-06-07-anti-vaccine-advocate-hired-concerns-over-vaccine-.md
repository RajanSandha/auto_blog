# Anti-Vaccine Advocate Hired: Concerns Over Vaccine Safety Data Access

Are you following the latest developments in public health? Recently, a controversial figure known for anti-vaccine advocacy has been hired at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This has sparked considerable debate, particularly concerning access to sensitive vaccine safety data. Let's dive into the details of this unfolding situation.

## The Controversy: David Geier's New Role

David Geier, a well-known advocate against vaccines, has begun working at HHS. According to reports from *The Wall Street Journal*, Geier is seeking access to vaccine safety data that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had previously restricted him from accessing. This move has raised eyebrows and triggered concerns among many in the scientific and medical communities.

## The Debunked Vaccine-Autism Link

Geier, along with his late father Mark Geier, has a long history of promoting the thoroughly debunked theory that vaccines cause autism. They have published numerous articles in less reputable journals, pushing this idea despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary.

*   Their primary focus has been on **thimerosal**, a mercury-containing preservative formerly used in some vaccines.
*   Numerous studies have found **no link** between thimerosal and autism.
*   Thimerosal was largely removed from vaccine formulations in 2001 as a precautionary measure.

It's important to emphasize that the scientific consensus is clear: vaccines are safe and effective, and they do not cause autism. 

## Past Disciplinary Actions

The Geiers' past actions have raised serious ethical and professional concerns. In 2011, the Maryland State Board of Physicians investigated the Geiers and found that they were misdiagnosing autistic children and treating them with unproven and potentially harmful hormone therapies.

*   Mark Geier had his medical license revoked as a result of these findings.
*   David Geier, who lacks a medical or scientific background and only holds a bachelor's degree, was disciplined for practicing medicine without a license.

These disciplinary actions highlight the serious nature of their past conduct and raise questions about their credibility in matters of public health.

## Concerns Regarding Data Access

The primary concern surrounding Geier's new role at HHS is his potential access to sensitive vaccine safety data. Given his history of promoting misinformation and his lack of scientific credentials, many fear that he may misuse this data to further his anti-vaccine agenda.

It is crucial to ensure that vaccine safety data is handled responsibly and that decisions regarding public health are based on sound scientific evidence, not on personal biases or debunked theories. 

## The Importance of Evidence-Based Public Health

This situation underscores the importance of evidence-based decision-making in public health. Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have for preventing infectious diseases, and it is essential to maintain public trust in their safety and efficacy.

*   Promoting misinformation about vaccines can have serious consequences, leading to lower vaccination rates and increased risk of outbreaks.
*   It is crucial to rely on credible sources of information, such as the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO), when making decisions about health.



## What Does This Mean for the Future?

It remains to be seen what impact David Geier's new role will have on public health policy. However, the situation serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges in combating misinformation and promoting evidence-based decision-making.

We must remain vigilant in our efforts to ensure that public health policies are based on sound science and that the public has access to accurate and reliable information about vaccines. 

## Key Takeaways

*   An anti-vaccine advocate, David Geier, has been hired at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
*   Concerns have been raised about his potential access to sensitive vaccine safety data.
*   Geier has a history of promoting the debunked theory that vaccines cause autism.
*   It is crucial to rely on evidence-based decision-making in public health.

Stay informed, stay critical, and always rely on credible sources of information when it comes to your health and the health of your community.
