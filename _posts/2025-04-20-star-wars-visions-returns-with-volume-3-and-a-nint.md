## Star Wars: Visions Returns with Volume 3 and a 'Ninth Jedi' Spinoff!

For fans of fresh and exciting takes on the galaxy far, far away, there's great news! *Star Wars: Visions*, the acclaimed animated anthology series on Disney+, is making a triumphant return. Despite the fluctuating fortunes of the wider *Star Wars* franchise, *Visions* has consistently delivered high-quality, innovative storytelling across its first two seasons. Now, prepare for even more as *Star Wars: Visions Volume 3* is on the horizon, along with a brand new spinoff series!

### Visions Volume 3: Continuing the Legacy

Mark your calendars! *Star Wars: Visions Volume 3* is set to premiere on **October 29th, 2025**. The announcement was made during Star Wars Celebration in Japan, generating considerable buzz among fans eager for more animated adventures. According to executive producer James Waugh, this season will consist of nine episodes, a thrilling expansion of the *Visions* universe.

But here's the real kicker: *Volume 3* won't just be introducing new stories. It will revisit and expand upon narratives from three beloved episodes from *Visions Volume 1*: "The Duel," "The Village Bride," and, most excitingly, "The Ninth Jedi."

### Star Wars: Visions Presents – The Ninth Jedi: A Spinoff is Born!

The most exciting news is that "The Ninth Jedi" is getting its own spinoff series, aptly titled *Star Wars: Visions Presents – The Ninth Jedi*, slated for release in 2026. This marks a significant shift for the *Visions* format, moving beyond self-contained anthology episodes into longer, more developed narratives.

"The Ninth Jedi" captivated audiences with its unique concept of lightsabers that change color based on the wielder's connection to the Force. Red signifies darkness, while blue represents the light. This intriguing exploration of the Force, combined with stunning animation, made it a standout episode. Kenji Kaniyama, the writer and director of the original episode, will be returning as the supervising director for the spinoff, ensuring continuity and maintaining the artistic vision that made "The Ninth Jedi" so compelling.

According to *The Hollywood Reporter*, *The Ninth Jedi* spinoff is just the beginning. Lucasfilm plans to create more *Visions Presents* spinoffs, allowing storytellers to delve deeper into the rich tapestry of the *Star Wars* universe and explore characters and concepts in more detail than the anthology format allows.

### A Global Collaboration of Animation Talent

Like its predecessors, *Star Wars: Visions Volume 3* showcases the incredible talent of various Japanese animation studios. Returning studios include Kamikaze Douga, Kinema Citrus Co., Production IG, and Trigger, all of whom have previously contributed memorable episodes to the *Visions* series.

But the talent pool is expanding! *Volume 3* will also feature fresh perspectives from newcomers such as Anima, David Production, Polygon Pictures, Project Studio Q, and WIT Studio. This diverse range of studios promises a wide array of animation styles and storytelling approaches, ensuring a vibrant and unpredictable season.

### What to Expect in Volume 3

During the Star Wars Celebration panel, Waugh and the filmmakers offered tantalizing glimpses of what's to come in *Volume 3*, showcasing character designs and artwork that hint at the season's diverse themes and visual styles.

One particularly intriguing detail revealed was an AT-AT, the iconic four-legged walker from *The Empire Strikes Back*, adorned with a traditional Japanese building on top. This fusion of familiar *Star Wars* elements with Japanese aesthetics perfectly embodies the spirit of *Visions*.

Masaki Tachibana from Kinema Citrus teased an "especially kawaii" (cute) episode titled *“Yuko’s Treasure,”* suggesting a lighthearted and charming adventure. Hiroyasu Kobayashi of Project Studio Q discussed their X-Wing-focused episode, *“The Song of Four Wings.”* Kobayashi emphasized their studio's expertise in mecha design, promising a focus on the intricate details of the X-Wing and the droids that support it. “We’re a studio that specializes in the creation of mechanisms,” Kobayashi said, “so we really focussed on the essence of the old Joe Johnston designs and featured a lot of droids and mechs.“

### Why This Matters

*Star Wars: Visions* is more than just an animated anthology; it's a testament to the enduring power of the *Star Wars* universe to inspire creativity and innovation. By giving talented animators from around the world the freedom to reimagine familiar themes and characters, *Visions* has consistently delivered fresh and exciting perspectives on the galaxy far, far away.

The decision to continue storylines from previous episodes and create spinoff series marks a significant evolution for the *Visions* format. It demonstrates Lucasfilm's commitment to investing in these unique stories and allowing them to grow beyond the confines of single episodes. This approach promises to enrich the *Star Wars* universe and offer fans even more reasons to be excited about the future of the franchise.

### The Future is Bright (and Animated)

With *Star Wars: Visions Volume 3* and *Star Wars: Visions Presents – The Ninth Jedi* on the horizon, the future of *Star Wars* animation looks incredibly bright. These projects promise to deliver stunning visuals, compelling stories, and a fresh perspective on the beloved franchise. Get ready to embark on a new adventure in the galaxy far, far away, and prepare to be amazed by the boundless creativity of *Star Wars: Visions*.
