Indie game marketplace Itch.io recently made waves by "deindexing" adult and NSFW (not-safe-for-work) games. This means these games are no longer easily discoverable through the platform's browse and search features. But what prompted this decision, and what does it mean for indie game developers?

Let's dive into the details and explore the implications of Itch.io's recent move.

## The Reason Behind the Change

According to Itch.io, this decision was a direct response to pressure from payment processors. An advocacy group, Collective Shout, launched a campaign targeting both Itch.io and Steam, criticizing them for selling games that depict violence against women. They directly addressed payment processors like PayPal, Mastercard, and Visa, questioning how facilitating payments for these games aligns with their corporate values.

This pressure seems to have worked. Steam announced earlier this month that it would ban games that violate the rules set forth by its payment processors. Itch.io followed suit, stating they needed to prioritize their relationship with payment partners to ensure the platform's continued operation.

Itch.io emphasized that a specific game, "No Mercy," which had previously been banned from the platform in April, was a catalyst for this urgent action. They stated the situation developed rapidly, forcing them to act quickly to protect their payment infrastructure, even without providing advance notice to creators.

## What Does "Deindexing" Mean?

Deindexing doesn't necessarily mean these games are completely removed from Itch.io. Instead, they are hidden from the main browse and search pages. Users can still access them directly if they know the game's specific URL or if the developer links to it from elsewhere.

## The Impact on Indie Developers

This change has sparked controversy among indie developers. Some criticize Itch.io for caving to pressure and potentially harming creators who rely on adult content sales. Concerns have been raised about the potential for payment processors to exert undue influence over the types of content allowed on online platforms.

One developer pointed out that Itch.io's terms state that adult content violations are "permanent with no chance of appeal" and that all funds in an offending account "will not be eligible for payout." This raises concerns about the financial security of developers who may inadvertently violate these rules.

## A Broader Trend?

Itch.io's decision is not an isolated incident. Other platforms, like Gumroad and OnlyFans, have faced similar pressure from payment processors regarding adult content. Gumroad implemented stricter rules around NSFW art, while OnlyFans initially banned explicit content before reversing the decision.

These instances suggest a growing trend of payment processors influencing content moderation policies on online platforms. This raises questions about free speech, censorship, and the role of financial institutions in regulating online content.

## The Payment Processor Perspective

Payment processors like Mastercard and Visa operate under strict regulatory frameworks and must comply with various laws and ethical guidelines. They also face pressure from advocacy groups and the public to prevent their services from being used to facilitate illegal or harmful activities.

From their perspective, allowing payments for content that depicts violence, exploitation, or other forms of abuse could damage their reputation and expose them to legal risks. Therefore, they may impose restrictions on certain types of content to mitigate these risks.

## The Future of Adult Content on Itch.io

Itch.io is currently conducting a "comprehensive audit" to ensure that all games on the marketplace comply with the requirements of their payment processors. After the audit, NSFW game creators will be required to confirm that their content is allowed under the policies of their payment processors.

It remains to be seen how this audit will affect the availability of adult content on Itch.io in the long term. It's possible that some games may be permanently removed, while others may be allowed to remain with stricter content warnings or age restrictions.

## Actionable Takeaway: Understanding Payment Processor Policies

For indie developers, the key takeaway is to thoroughly understand the policies of the payment processors they use. Before creating and publishing content, especially adult or potentially controversial content, research the specific rules and restrictions imposed by PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, and other relevant payment providers. This can help you avoid potential violations and ensure your content remains accessible.

## The Ethical Considerations

The debate over adult content often involves complex ethical considerations. Freedom of expression, artistic license, and the rights of creators must be balanced against concerns about exploitation, harm, and the potential impact on vulnerable individuals.

There's no easy answer, and different platforms and communities will have different standards. However, open dialogue and a willingness to engage with these complex issues are essential for finding solutions that respect both creative freedom and ethical responsibility.
