### What is Therabody?

Therabody has become a leader in the wellness tech space. They're known for their percussive therapy devices (like the Theragun), but they also offer a range of products including:

*   **Theraguns:** Percussive therapy devices for muscle recovery.
*   **TheraFace Pro:** A facial health device with multiple modalities.
*   **RecoveryAir:** Pneumatic compression systems for improved circulation.
*   **SmartGoggles:** Smart eye massager.
*   **Other Wellness Products:** Including LED masks, and more.

These devices are designed to help with muscle soreness, pain relief, and overall well-being. But, they can be pricey. So, let's dive into how you can save!

## How to Find Therabody Discount Codes and Deals

While dedicated Therabody promo codes are relatively infrequent, there are several avenues to explore for potential savings:

### 1. Sign Up for Email and Text Alerts

One of the easiest ways to get a discount is by signing up for Therabody's email and text alerts. New subscribers often receive a welcome discount. Currently you can receive:

*   **10% Off:** When you sign up for emails.
*   **15% Off:** When you sign up for text messages.

This is a great way to get an immediate discount on your first order. Be sure to use the discount code within 30 days, as it may expire.

### 2. Explore Therabody's Sale Offers

Therabody frequently has rotating sale offers on their website. Keep an eye out for deals like:

*   **Percentage Discounts:** Such as 15% off select items.
*   **Free Shipping:** On orders over a certain amount (e.g., $99).
*   **Specific Product Discounts:** Like $100 off the TheraPRO (5th gen).

### 3. Check Out the Therabody Outlet

For budget-conscious shoppers, the Therabody Outlet is a goldmine. Here, you can find:

*   **Certified Refurbished Devices:** These are devices that have been inspected and restored to like-new condition.
*   **Last Chance Offers:** Discounts on older generation devices.
*   **Discounts Up to 30% Off:** On products like the Theragun Prime Plus, TheraFace, SmartGoggles, and RecoveryAir Jetboots.

These refurbished products come with a 30-day guarantee and a 1-year warranty (when you register the product), giving you peace of mind.

### 4. Military, Student, and Healthcare Discounts

Therabody offers special discounts to certain groups:

*   **Military Personnel, Healthcare Workers, and First Responders:** Receive a 20% discount (verification required through ID.me).
*   **Students and Teachers:** Qualify for a 10% discount.

If you fall into one of these categories, be sure to take advantage of these savings.

### 5. Use FSA/HSA Dollars

Some Therabody products may be eligible for purchase using your Flexible Spending Account (FSA) or Health Savings Account (HSA) dollars. Check the eligibility of specific products to see if you can use your pre-tax dollars.

### 6. Bundle Deals

Therabody often offers discounts when you purchase bundles of two or more products. These bundles can include limited-edition items and offer significant savings compared to buying each product individually. Examples include The On-The-Go bundle, The Complete mini bundle, Beauty Sleep bundle, and The Complete TheraFace bundle.

## When to Find the Best Therabody Deals

Historically, the best times to find Therabody discounts are during major shopping holidays:

*   **Black Friday**
*   **Cyber Monday**
*   **December Holiday Sales**
*   **Memorial Day**
*   **Labor Day**

Keep an eye out for seasonal flash sales, particularly in the beauty category, where you might find coupon codes for specific products like TheraFace masks.
