Homeowners, take note! A significant recall has been issued for approximately 780,000 Ryobi pressure washers due to a potential explosion risk. If you own a Ryobi pressure washer, especially models RY142300 and RY142711VNM, it's crucial to check if your unit is affected.

## Serious Risk: Overheating Capacitors

The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued a warning about the potential hazard. According to the notice, the pressure washer's capacitor can overheat and burst, forcefully ejecting parts. This poses a serious risk of injury to both the user and anyone nearby. Imagine a component suddenly exploding – that's the severity of the situation.

Ryobi has received a concerning number of reports. There have been 135 instances of capacitors overheating, including 41 reports of explosions. Tragically, these incidents have resulted in 32 injuries affecting fingers, hands, faces, and eyes. This highlights the very real danger associated with these recalled models.

## Which Ryobi Pressure Washers Are Affected?

The recall specifically targets Ryobi pressure washers with model numbers RY142300 and RY142711VNM. These units were sold at Home Depot and Direct Tools Factory Outlet between July 2017 and June 2024. The price range was between $300 and $400.

While most of the affected units were sold in the United States, approximately 16,000 were sold in Canada. Regardless of location, if you own one of these models, immediate action is required.

## What to Do if You Own a Recalled Unit

**The most important step: Stop using the pressure washer immediately!**

1.  **Verify Your Model:** Visit Ryobi's dedicated recall website to confirm if your specific model is included in the recall.
2.  **Free Replacement:** If your pressure washer is affected, you are entitled to a free replacement capacitor. This includes the cost of shipping and detailed installation instructions.
3.  **No Proof of Purchase Needed:** The good news is that you don't need a receipt or any proof of purchase to claim your free replacement capacitor.

## Why This Matters: A Tech Perspective

While a pressure washer might not seem like a high-tech gadget, this recall highlights the importance of safety standards and quality control in all manufactured goods. Even seemingly simple devices rely on electronic components, and a failure in one area (like a capacitor) can have serious consequences. This situation also underscores the significance of proactive recalls. Ryobi's response, offering free replacements without requiring proof of purchase, demonstrates a commitment to customer safety – a crucial aspect of responsible tech manufacturing.

It's also worth noting that the recalled Ryobi models were not included in CNET's list of best pressure washers. This further emphasizes the importance of researching product reviews and safety ratings before making a purchase. Independent reviews can often highlight potential issues that might not be immediately apparent.

### Actionable Takeaway:

*   **Check Your Tools Regularly:** This recall serves as a reminder to regularly inspect your power tools and appliances for any signs of damage or malfunction. Don't ignore warning signs like unusual noises, overheating, or strange smells. Early detection can prevent accidents and injuries.
