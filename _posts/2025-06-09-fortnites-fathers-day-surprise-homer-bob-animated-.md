## Fortnite's Father's Day Surprise: Homer, Bob & Animated Dads Unite!

Get ready for a crossover of epic (and hilarious) proportions! Rumor has it that Fortnite is gearing up for a *dad-tastic* Father's Day celebration, and it involves some of the most iconic animated fathers from your favorite TV shows. Prepare to drop into the battle royale as Homer Simpson, Bob Belcher, and more!

### The Leaks Are In: A Father's Day Fortnite Fiesta?

According to the ever-reliable Fortnite leaker @ShiinaBR, we might be seeing some familiar faces joining the Fortnite roster. We're talking about a potential *Fortnite x Fox* collaboration that would bring animated TV dads to the island. Imagine this: you, as Homer Simpson, building a fort and battling it out for that Victory Royale. Sounds pretty wild, right?



Here's the rumored lineup:

*   **Bob Belcher** (Bob's Burgers)
*   **Hank Hill** (King of the Hill)
*   **Cleveland Brown** (The Cleveland Show)
*   **Homer Simpson** (The Simpsons)

While Epic Games hasn't officially confirmed anything yet, the evidence is mounting. Three of these skins have reportedly been spotted in the game files, and there have been hints of a Simpsons collaboration through official channels. The hype is real, folks!

### King of the Hill Hints: Propane and Victory Royales?

Back in May, eagle-eyed fans noticed some interesting assets in the game files labeled "Propane Specialist" referencing Arlen, Texas – Hank Hill's hometown. This sparked speculation about a possible King of the Hill collaboration, and now it seems like those rumors might be coming true. Can you imagine Hank Hill building a base with propane tanks? I tell you hwat, that'd be something!

### Why This Crossover Works So Well

Fortnite is known for its crazy and unexpected pop culture crossovers. From Marvel superheroes to iconic movie characters, the game has seen it all. But this Father's Day collaboration feels particularly special. It's a clever way to celebrate fatherhood by tapping into the humor and heart of these beloved animated dads. Think about it: awkward moments, endearing qualities, burger-flipping skills, and maybe even a beer or two – these dads embody the spirit of Father's Day in their own unique ways.

### What to Expect

If these leaks are accurate, we can expect these skins to be available in the Fortnite Item Shop around Father's Day. They'll likely come with their own unique cosmetic items, such as back bling, pickaxes, and emotes. Just imagine Homer Simpson doing the floss dance – pure comedic gold!

### The Future of Fortnite Collaborations

This potential *Father's Day collaboration* highlights Fortnite's continued dedication to creative and engaging content. By partnering with popular franchises like *The Simpsons* and *Bob's Burgers*, Epic Games is able to attract a wider audience and keep the game fresh and exciting. Who knows what other crossovers we might see in the future? Maybe we'll get a Rick and Morty skin, or perhaps even a Family Guy collaboration. The possibilities are endless!

### Stay Tuned for More Updates

As we get closer to Father's Day, be sure to keep an eye out for official announcements from Epic Games. We'll be sure to update this post with any new information as it becomes available. In the meantime, get ready to drop into Fortnite as your favorite animated dad and show everyone what you've got!
