## Daydream's AI Chatbot: Your New Fashion Shopping Assistant

Are you tired of endless scrolling and generic search results when shopping for clothes online? Get ready for a revolution in fashion e-commerce! Julie Bornstein's startup, **Daydream**, is launching its innovative **AI-powered chatbot**, designed to transform the way you discover and purchase fashion items. After securing a significant $50 million seed round, Daydream is ready to bring a personalized and intuitive shopping experience to the masses.

### What is Daydream and Why Should You Care?

Daydream isn't just another e-commerce platform. It's a smart shopping assistant that leverages the power of **artificial intelligence** to understand your unique style and preferences. Imagine being able to describe the *perfect* outfit for a specific occasion, or simply uploading a picture of something you like and letting the **AI search** engine find similar items. That's the promise of Daydream.

### How Does the AI Chatbot Work?

The Daydream chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1.  **Sign-Up and Onboarding:** New users are prompted to provide basic information such as their name, birthdate, preferred price range, and brand preferences. This initial data helps the AI understand your general style.
2.  **Natural Language Search:** Forget rigid keyword searches! You can type in complex queries like, "I want a dress to wear to a summer wedding in Paris." The AI understands the context and intent behind your request.
3.  **Image-Based Search:** Have a picture of something you love? Upload it to the chatbot and add textual context to refine your search. The AI will analyze the image and find visually similar items.
4.  **Personalized Style Passport:** Based on your initial input and ongoing feedback, Daydream creates a "style passport" that drives personalized recommendations. This ensures that the suggestions you see are relevant to your taste.
5.  **Refine and Save:** Easily save items to collections and refine your search by providing additional feedback to the chatbot. Want a different color or style? Simply tap the "Say More" button to edit your search.

### Key Features and Benefits

*   **AI-Powered Search:** The core of Daydream is its advanced AI, which understands nuanced queries and visual cues to deliver highly relevant results.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:** The style passport ensures that you see items that match your individual taste and preferences.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** The chatbot is easy to use, making the shopping experience enjoyable and efficient.
*   **Vast Catalog:** Daydream boasts over 8,000 brands at launch, with new merchants being added regularly.

### The Vision Behind Daydream

Julie Bornstein, a seasoned e-commerce veteran with experience at Nordstrom, Urban Outfitters, Sephora, and Stitch Fix, recognized the limitations of traditional search methods in the fashion world. "Having worked in e-commerce my whole career, search has always been the forgotten child, and it never worked very well," Bornstein told TechCrunch. She aims to address this issue by leveraging the power of AI to create a more intuitive and personalized shopping experience.

"But once Chat GPT launched, you know, consumers started to get trained on how to think about the potential of prompting. And so what we’re trying to do is help allow you to ask whatever it is you wanna ask, whether it’s I have an occasion, or I have this need, or I’m looking for this very specific kind of thing," she said.

### The Tech Behind the Style

Maria Belousova, Daydream's CTO, emphasizes the importance of understanding the nuances of each item in the catalog. The platform uses **image visual recognition** and other advanced techniques to analyze stylistic and social attributes, ensuring that search results are highly accurate and relevant.

"We are doing quite a bit to understand the details of the product, such as knowing stylistic attributes like embellishments, silhouette, or even social attributes like who would wear this dress, such as a bride or a guest in a wedding. We are also using image visual recognition to satisfy detailed queries where a customer describes the exact product they want," Belousova said.

### What's Next for Daydream?

Daydream has ambitious plans for the future, including:

*   **Explicit Feedback:** Allowing users to provide more specific feedback, such as "Don't show me any four-inch heels."
*   **Matching Suggestions:** Helping users find items that complement existing pieces in their wardrobe.
*   **Social Sharing:** Enabling users to share their saved items with friends and family for suggestions and feedback.
*   **Collaborative Collections:** Allowing users to modify and adapt collections created by others.

### Daydream vs. the Competition

While Daydream focuses specifically on fashion, other startups like  and  are also exploring multimodal search for shopping. Tech giants like  and  are also investing in AI-powered shopping features. However, Daydream's focus on personalization and its chatbot interface may give it a unique edge in the market.
