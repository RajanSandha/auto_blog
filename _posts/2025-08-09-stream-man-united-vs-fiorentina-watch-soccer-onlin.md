## When and Where is the Game?

The Man United vs. Fiorentina match took place on Saturday, August 9th, at Old Trafford. Kickoff was at 12:45 p.m. BST (UK time). That translates to:

*   7:45 a.m. ET (US East Coast)
*   4:45 a.m. PT (US West Coast)
*   9:45 p.m. AEST (Australia Eastern Standard Time)

While the game has already occurred, the information below is still valuable for understanding how to watch similar matches in the future.

## How to Watch the Game Live

Unfortunately, the game was not broadcast on mainstream TV channels in the UK, US, or Canada. However, there were still ways to watch:

### 1. MUTV: Manchester United's Official Streaming Service

*   **What it is:** MUTV is Manchester United's in-house streaming service. It offers exclusive content, including player interviews, match replays, and live games (including women's and academy matches).
*   **Cost:** An annual subscription to MUTV is around Â£30.
*   **Availability:** MUTV was the primary way to watch the Man United vs. Fiorentina friendly live.

### 2. Using a VPN to Bypass Geo-Restrictions

If you were traveling abroad and wanted to watch the game, a **VPN** (Virtual Private Network) would be your best bet. Here's how it works:

*   **What a VPN does:** A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a server in a location of your choice. This makes it appear as if you are browsing from that location.
*   **Why it's useful:** If MUTV was only showing the game in certain regions, you could use a VPN to connect to a server in one of those regions and access the stream.
*   **Important Considerations:**
    *   VPNs are legal in many countries, but some streaming services might have terms of service that restrict VPN use.
    *   Always check the streaming platform's terms of service before using a VPN.
    *   Ensure you comply with all applicable laws and service agreements.

### Choosing a VPN: ExpressVPN

**ExpressVPN** is often recommended as a reliable **VPN** for streaming due to its speed and wide server network. It boasts:

*   3,000+ servers in 105 countries
*   Strong privacy features (no DNS leaks)
*   User-friendly apps for various devices

Keep an eye out for special offers. ExpressVPN often has deals on longer-term subscriptions. Note that they also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.

### 3. BeIn Sports (Australia)

For fans in Australia, BeIn Sports Connect offers access to a wide range of soccer matches, including preseason friendlies. A subscription costs around AU$15 per month or AU$130 per year.

## Tips for Streaming with a VPN

Streaming with a **VPN** can sometimes be tricky. Here are some tips to troubleshoot potential issues:

*   **Location, Location, Location:** If you don't see your desired location in your VPN app, use the search function.
*   **Account Address:** Make sure the address registered with your streaming service account matches the location you're connecting to via VPN. If not, update your account information.
*   **Smart TV Issues:** Some smart TVs don't support VPN apps directly. In this case, install the VPN on your router or mobile hotspot to route all traffic through the VPN.
*   **Router Setup:** Most VPN providers offer detailed instructions on how to install their VPN on your router.

## Key Takeaways

*   MUTV is the official streaming service for Manchester United content.
*   A **VPN** can help you bypass geographical restrictions and access streams from anywhere.
*   Always check the terms of service of your streaming provider before using a VPN.
*   ExpressVPN is a popular and reliable VPN option.
*   BeIn Sports is a good option for soccer fans in Australia.
