The game's popularity has exploded, becoming a social media sensation. Wyna Liu, an associate puzzle editor at the *Times*, is credited with playing a key role in developing this addictive game. You can play *Connections* on your web browser or mobile device, making it a perfect way to engage your brain on the go.

#### How to Play

1.  **Examine the 16 words:** Carefully read all the words presented in the puzzle.
2.  **Identify potential connections:** Look for common themes, synonyms, or associations between the words.
3.  **Group the words:** Select four words that you believe belong to the same category.
4.  **Submit your guess:** Once you've chosen your four words, submit your guess.
5.  **Learn from your mistakes:** You have four attempts to solve the puzzle. Use each mistake as a learning opportunity to refine your strategy.
