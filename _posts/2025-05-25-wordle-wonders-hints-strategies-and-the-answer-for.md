### A Brief History of Wordle Mania

Wordle, initially a personal project by engineer Josh Wardle for his partner, quickly blossomed into a global sensation. Its simple yet addictive gameplay captivated millions, leading to a surge of fan-made variations like Squabble (a battle royale Wordle), Heardle (a music-based guessing game), and the more challenging Dordle and Quordle (where you guess multiple words simultaneously).

The game's immense popularity eventually caught the eye of the *New York Times*, who acquired it and integrated it into their suite of online games. Today, Wordle continues to be a daily ritual for countless individuals, some of whom even share their gameplay experiences on platforms like TikTok.

## Level Up Your Wordle Game

### The Quest for the Perfect Starting Word

The age-old question: what's the *best* Wordle starting word? The truth is, there's no single magic bullet. The ideal starting word is subjective and depends on your personal preferences and play style. However, a strategic approach can certainly improve your odds.

One widely recommended tip is to choose a word containing at least two different vowels and some common consonants like S, T, R, or N. This maximizes your chances of uncovering valuable information early on.

### The Curious Case of the Wordle Archive

Remember the days when you could revisit past Wordle puzzles at your leisure? The complete Wordle archive was once a treasure trove for enthusiasts, allowing them to practice, analyze, and relive their favorite challenges. However, the archive was eventually taken down, reportedly at the request of the *New York Times*.

Fortunately, the *New York Times* has since launched its own Wordle Archive, offering access to past puzzles exclusively for NYT Games subscribers.

### Is Wordle Getting Harder? The Million-Dollar Question

Have you ever felt like Wordle is becoming increasingly difficult? Rest assured, you're not alone. Many players have voiced similar concerns. However, the underlying difficulty of Wordle hasn't actually changed since its inception. The puzzles are designed to be consistently challenging, but not unfairly so.

If you're seeking an extra layer of difficulty, you can always activate Wordle's Hard Mode, which forces you to use any revealed hints in subsequent guesses.
