## Cult of the Lamb Comic Returns: Schism Special Coming This Fall

Great news for fans of the adorably dark world of *Cult of the Lamb*! The comic book expansion is making a comeback with a brand-new one-shot issue titled *Cult of the Lamb: Schism Special #1*.  If you enjoyed the previous miniseries, which delved deeper into the game's lore with surprising emotional depth, get ready for more. 

Writer Alex Paknadel and artist Troy Little are teaming up again to continue the Lamb's story and the struggles of their devoted (and sometimes not-so-devoted) followers.  Prepare for more cuteness, more brutality, and more of the unique world that made *Cult of the Lamb* such a hit.

### What's the Schism Special About?

According to Oni Press, *Schism Special* picks up after the emotionally charged events of the first story arc.  Here's a glimpse of what's in store:

> In the aftermath of their first and closest follower’s sacrifice, Lamb continues the bloody quest to defeat the Bishops of the Old Faith, but they lack the conviction to tend their growing flock back at the cult. More potential followers are rescued by the day, but with no one to indoctrinate them, Lamb’s power stagnates and The One Who Waits becomes weary of his earthly vessel’s resistance to the full power and responsibility of the Red Crown. When famine strikes the cult, a challenger to Lamb’s mantle emerges, and a new struggle begins…

Sounds intense, right?  The Lamb faces new challenges, both from external enemies and internal struggles within their own cult.  Expect power struggles, dwindling resources, and maybe even a little bit of existential dread.  Hey, running a cult isn't easy!

### When and Where Can You Get It?

*Cult of the Lamb: Schism Special #1* will be available on **October 29th** for $8.  Keep an eye out for covers by Troy Little and Peach Momoko, as well as a foil variant for $10. Make sure to check your local comic book store or online retailers.
