## Which Crayan Mattresses Are Being Recalled?

The recall specifically targets Crayan Mattresses' 10-inch and 12-inch mattresses in twin, full, queen, and king sizes. These mattresses were sold on Amazon.com from June 2022 through June 2024.

Here's how to identify a recalled mattress:

*   **Sizes:** Twin, Full, Queen, and King.
*   **Thickness:** 10-inch or 12-inch.
*   **Design:** Single-sided with a white-knit quilted top and gray side panels.
*   **Branding:** The brand name 'Crayan' is stitched into the front foot panel in white letters.

Crayan Inc. (Foshanshi Liyue Jiaju Youxian Gongsi, dba), the retailer, is based in China, and the mattresses are manufactured in Japan. They are typically delivered compressed in a box. The **Crayan mattresses** were sold in the price range of $100 to $220.

### How to Check Your Mattress Tag

Pay close attention to the mattress tag. The CPSC provides examples of the tag labels on the recalled mattresses .

## Why the Mattress Recall? Understanding the Fire Hazard

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) mandates that all mattresses and mattress pads sold in the United States must adhere to strict open flame flammability requirements, as outlined in 16 CFR 1633 . These standards are in place to minimize the risk of fires.

Unfortunately, the recalled **Crayan mattress** models failed to meet these critical safety standards, creating a potential **fire hazard** that could lead to serious injury or even death. While no incidents or injuries have been reported to date, the risk is significant enough to warrant an immediate recall.

## What to Do If You Have a Recalled Mattress: Steps to Take Immediately

If you own a recalled Crayan mattress, follow these steps to ensure your safety and receive a refund:

1.  **Stop Using the Mattress:** Immediately discontinue use of the mattress.
2.  **Mark the Mattress:** Permanently mark the mattress with the word 'Recalled' in large letters across the white top panel. This prevents accidental reuse or resale.
3.  **Contact Crayan Mattresses:** Email a photo of the marked mattress to crayan_service@hotmail.com to confirm your purchase and initiate the refund process.
4.  **Expect a Full Refund:** Upon confirmation, you should receive a full refund for your purchase.
