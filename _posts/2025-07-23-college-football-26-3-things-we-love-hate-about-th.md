EA Sports is back on the college gridiron with *College Football 26*! After spending some time with the game, it's clear: it's decent, but not groundbreaking. It's an okay follow-up to last year's reboot, but it definitely has its ups and downs.

Last year, *CFB 25* had massive hype. After a decade-long absence, the franchise returned, but stumbled with missing features, buggy simulations, weak commentary, and underdeveloped game modes. While some claimed it was better than Madden, the foundation had cracks.

*College Football 26* is an improvement, but still flawed. There's potential, and it's fun, but EA seems to treat it like a chore instead of a major opportunity.

Here's a breakdown of three things we love and three things we can't stand about *CFB 26*.

## Love: High School is Back in Road to Glory

A fan-favorite feature from *NCAA Football 14* returns: high school football in Road to Glory (RTG). You start your career under the Friday night lights, earning recruiting stars and scholarship offers based on your performance. Top programs will notice you if you perform well. If not, you can still walk on at your dream school and work your way up.

It's great to see high school back in the mode. However, there's a catch.

## Hate: High School RTG is Half-Baked

While the return of high school is welcome, it's a major downgrade compared to previous versions. In *NCAA Football 12*, you could play a full high school season. Now, in *CFB 26*, it's reduced to just four games, and not even full ones. You only play isolated "highlight moments."

Before each game, you choose from pre-set scenarios like a "2-Minute Drill" or "Red Zone Threat," with specific objectives. Succeed, and you earn recruiting points. Fail, and your stock drops. Some scenarios are school-specific, giving you chances to impress certain programs.

In theory, it's decent. But in practice, it's clunky and restrictive. Some objectives are broken, such as a "scramble for 50+ yards" challenge that doesn't register if you score a touchdown.

This stripped-down version feels disconnected. Players wanted the full high school season back, but this feels rushed.

## Love: Historical Data and Trophy Room

One of the coolest additions is the inclusion of historical data and a trophy room. This adds depth and replayability to the game, allowing players to track their progress and achievements over time.

### Dynasty Mode Depth

*College Football 26* adds a layer of immersion to Dynasty mode with historical data tracking. You can view past Heisman winners, national champions, and conference standings. This creates a sense of legacy and allows you to compare your program's success to historical benchmarks.

### Trophy Room

The Trophy Room is a virtual display case where you can showcase your team's accomplishments. Win a national championship? It goes on display. Dominate your conference? A trophy for that too. This provides a visual representation of your dynasty's achievements and adds a sense of pride to building a successful program.

## Hate: Commentary Still Needs Work

While the gameplay has improved, the commentary remains a weak point. Repetitive lines and a lack of excitement can detract from the overall experience. It's an area that EA Sports needs to address to truly elevate the game.

### Repetitive Dialogue

After a few games, you'll start to notice the same commentary lines being repeated. This can become grating and break the immersion. Fresh and dynamic commentary is crucial for keeping the game engaging over the long term.

### Lack of Excitement

The commentary often lacks the energy and excitement that you'd expect from a college football game. Big plays and crucial moments are often met with a subdued reaction, which can make the game feel less impactful.

## Love: Improved Gameplay Mechanics

*College Football 26* features noticeable improvements to the gameplay mechanics. Player movement feels more fluid, and the passing game is more responsive. These enhancements make the game more enjoyable to play and provide a more authentic college football experience.

### Fluid Player Movement

The players move more realistically, with smoother transitions and more responsive controls. This allows you to execute plays with greater precision and feel more in control of the action.

### Responsive Passing Game

The passing game has been refined, with improved accuracy and responsiveness. You can now make more precise throws and execute complex passing plays with greater ease.

## Hate: Lingering Bugs and Glitches

Despite the improvements, *College Football 26* still suffers from lingering bugs and glitches. These issues can range from minor visual hiccups to game-breaking errors that disrupt the gameplay experience. Addressing these bugs is essential for providing a polished and enjoyable game.

### Visual Glitches

Occasional visual glitches can detract from the immersion. These can include clipping issues, texture problems, and other graphical anomalies.

### Game-Breaking Errors

More serious bugs can sometimes disrupt the gameplay experience. These can include freezes, crashes, and other errors that force you to restart the game.

## Actionable Takeaway

Don't expect a revolutionary experience. *College Football 26* is a step in the right direction, but it's not a perfect game. If you're a die-hard college football fan, you'll find some enjoyment in it. But be aware of its flaws before you dive in. Manage your expectations accordingly.

## Key Takeaways

*   High school football returns to Road to Glory, but it's a simplified version.
*   Historical data and a trophy room add depth to Dynasty mode.
*   Commentary needs improvement.
*   Gameplay mechanics have been enhanced.
*   Lingering bugs and glitches persist.

## FAQ

**Q: What's the biggest improvement in *College Football 26*?**

## Summary

*College Football 26* is a mixed bag. It has some improvements, but also some lingering issues. It's a decent game, but not a must-have. The return of high school football is welcome, but its execution is disappointing. The gameplay mechanics are better, but the commentary and bugs need work. Ultimately, it's a game with potential, but it needs more polish to truly shine.
