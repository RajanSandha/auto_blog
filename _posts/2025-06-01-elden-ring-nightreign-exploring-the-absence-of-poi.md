## Elden Ring Nightreign: Exploring the Absence of Poison Swamps, Future DLC, and Ishizaki's Design Philosophy

*Elden Ring* has taken the gaming world by storm, and now *Elden Ring Nightreign* is offering a fresh take on the beloved formula. This new title, a co-op multiplayer experience, marks a bold step for FromSoftware. In this interview with director Junya Ishizaki, we delve into the design choices, gameplay philosophy, and potential future of *Nightreign*, uncovering the secrets behind this exciting new direction for the *Elden Ring* universe and discussing future *FromSoftware games*.

## The Ishizaki Touch: Game Feel and Player Comfort

*Nightreign* distinguishes itself from previous FromSoftware titles, particularly those directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, through its emphasis on "game feel." Ishizaki explains his focus on the player's interaction with the controls and how it translates to a comfortable and enjoyable experience. He prioritizes the detailed, fine-tuned aspects of gameplay, like the feeling of landing after a fall. 

>"I like to prioritize the 'game feel' more than a lot of things -- these detailed and fine-tuned things, like what happens when a player falls from a height and hits the ground? How is this supposed to feel? And how does this translate into good-feeling gameplay and into player comfort?"

This philosophy is evident in *Nightreign*'s design choices, such as the absence of fall damage, which allows players to explore the world with greater freedom and less frustration. Ishizaki's attention to detail in the player-control relationship is a key element that sets *Nightreign* apart.

## The Mystery of the Missing Poison Swamp

One of the most intriguing questions surrounding *Nightreign* is the absence of a poison swamp, a staple in many FromSoftware games. Ishizaki's response is both humorous and insightful:

>"I think the main reason is that this is not a Miyazaki title so that could be one explanation. Jokes aside, I think it's just a serendipitous factor of game development and what goes into the idea process and what comes out. So who knows what could happen in the future with Nightreign?"

While the lack of a poison swamp might disappoint some fans, it reflects *Nightreign*'s unique identity and its departure from established FromSoftware conventions. The decision was a result of the game's development process and the specific vision for *Nightreign*.

### Scarlet Rot: A Substitute for the Swamp?

Though there's no traditional poison swamp, *Nightreign* does feature areas infested with scarlet rot. While not exactly the same, these areas provide a similar challenge and atmosphere, forcing players to navigate treacherous terrain and manage their status effects carefully. .

## Drawing Inspiration: Dark Souls and Beyond

*Nightreign* draws inspiration from previous FromSoftware titles, incorporating familiar bosses and elements from the *Dark Souls* series. Ishizaki explains the selection process:

>"From a gameplay perspective and our sense of, first of all, would they be a good fit for the world and structure of Nightreign… We wanted to make sure that they adapt to Nightreign's framework and gameplay as well, and add to that in order to make the experience fresh."

The inclusion of bosses like the Gaping Dragon demonstrates *Nightreign*'s ability to blend familiar elements with its unique gameplay mechanics. This approach creates a sense of nostalgia for longtime fans while providing a fresh and challenging experience.

### The Potential for Crossovers: Armored Core?

The interview also touches on the possibility of crossovers with other FromSoftware franchises, such as *Armored Core*. While Ishizaki doesn't confirm any specific plans, he acknowledges the respect the team has for other creators within the company:

>"We have a very high level of respect for the games that other directors and other creators in the company have created and we never wanted this to feel like a random grab bag kind of approach... As to the question of an Armored Core or mecha crossover … who knows?"

While a crossover with *Armored Core* remains uncertain, the possibility highlights the potential for future collaborations and the rich universe of FromSoftware games.

## Ishizaki's Favorite: The Nightfarer Class

When asked about his favorite Nightfarer class, Ishizaki reveals his personal preference:

>"I like to use the Nightfarer. I am the kind of person that likes to play with all of the tricks and tools that are available. Nightfarer has the widest breadth of tricks and tools and it is a very versatile class. You can do a lot of things with it and it is a very fun class to play as."

This insight into Ishizaki's playstyle provides valuable context for understanding the design of *Nightreign*. His preference for versatility and adaptability is reflected in the game's diverse character classes and gameplay options.

## Future DLC and FromSoftware's Vision

The interview concludes with a glimpse into the future of *Nightreign* and FromSoftware's overall vision. While specific details about future DLC are scarce, Ishizaki's comments suggest that the team is committed to supporting the game and expanding its world.

Furthermore, the mention of *The Duskbloods*, potentially coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, hints at FromSoftware's continued exploration of new platforms and genres. .

## Conclusion: A New Era for FromSoftware

*Elden Ring Nightreign* represents a significant evolution for FromSoftware, showcasing the studio's willingness to experiment with new gameplay mechanics and explore different aspects of the *Elden Ring* universe. Junya Ishizaki's design philosophy, with its emphasis on game feel and player comfort, is shaping a unique and engaging experience.
