## Why You Need AirTag Accessories

AirTags themselves are just small discs. They don't have a built-in way to attach them to anything. That's where **AirTag accessories** come in. They provide the necessary means to connect your AirTag to your belongings. 

Think of it this way: an AirTag without an accessory is like a key without a keyring. It can still work, but it's much less convenient and secure.

Here’s why investing in accessories is a smart move:

*   **Attachment:** The primary reason! Accessories let you attach your AirTag to keys, bags, pet collars, and more.
*   **Protection:** Some accessories offer a layer of protection against scratches, bumps, and even water damage.
*   **Personalization:** Express your style with a range of colors, materials, and designs.
