## Freitag F685 Henry: A Messenger Bag Made From Trash That's Built to Last

Remember the iconic image of the 90s San Francisco bicycle messenger, effortlessly weaving through traffic, their crossbody bag bulging with deliveries?  That's the spirit Freitag embodies, and their latest creation, the F685 Henry messenger bag, perfectly captures that essence.  This isn't your average bag; it's a testament to sustainable design and unparalleled durability.

### A Legacy of Recycled Style

Founded in 1993 in Switzerland, Freitag has built its reputation on crafting messenger bags from recycled materials.  Their commitment to sustainability is evident in the Henry, which is meticulously constructed from repurposed seatbelts, recycled plastic bottles, and used truck tarpsâ€”materials that would otherwise end up in landfills.  This unique approach not only minimizes environmental impact but also results in a bag with a distinct, one-of-a-kind character. No two Freitag bags are exactly alike, making each one a truly unique statement piece.
