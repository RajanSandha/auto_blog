## FBC: Firebreak Beginner's Guide: 9 Tips to Survive Your First Shift

So, you've decided to become a Firebreaker in **FBC: Firebreak**? Get ready for a wild ride! This live-service multiplayer game from Remedy Entertainment throws you headfirst into the paranatural chaos of the Oldest House. Think *Left 4 Dead* meets *Control*, and you're on the right track. But fear not, new recruit! This guide is packed with **beginner tips** to help you survive your first shift and become a valuable asset to the Bureau. Let's dive in!

This blog post will cover essential strategies for success in Firebreak, focusing on teamwork, effective communication (even without voice chat!), and maximizing the potential of each Kit. We'll also explore weapon choices and synergistic ability combinations to help you conquer the Hiss and other threats lurking within the Oldest House.

## What is FBC: Firebreak?

**FBC: Firebreak** is a cooperative horde shooter set within the universe of Remedy Entertainment's critically acclaimed game, *Control*. Six years after the events of *Control*, players take on the role of Firebreakers, volunteers tasked with containing paranormal threats and Hiss invasions within the Oldest House, a constantly shifting and unpredictable location.

The game emphasizes teamwork, strategic use of abilities, and skillful first-person shooting. Success hinges on coordinating with your squad to overcome challenging encounters and survive the ever-present dangers of the Oldest House. Now, letâ€™s get you prepared for your first shift!

## 1. Assemble Your Squad: Crossplay is Your Friend

**FBC: Firebreak** boasts full crossplay compatibility between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. This means you can team up with friends regardless of their preferred platform. Camaraderie and coordinated team play are crucial for survival, so gather your most reliable allies.

*   **Pro Tip:** While crossplay is available, cross-progression is not. Your level-ups, perks, and Kit unlocks are tied to the platform you're playing on.

## 2. Communication is Key (Even Without Voice Chat!)

One of the more controversial design choices in **Firebreak** is the absence of in-game voice or text chat. This makes communication a bit tricky, but not impossible. The ping system becomes your lifeline.

*   **Utilize the Ping System:**
    *   Mark enemy waves your teammates haven't spotted.
    *   Ping your intended destination to maintain team cohesion.
    *   Highlight shelters before triggering enemy spawns.
    *   Indicate available healing showers, sinks, and ammunition.

Live and die by the ping system. It's the only way to share vital information and coordinate effectively with your squad.

## 3. Kit Selection: Splash Kit Shines in Multiplayer

**Firebreak** offers three distinct Kits, each with unique abilities and playstyles:

*   **Jump Kit:** Excels at restarting electronics quickly.
*   **Fix Kit:** Speeds up repairs to showers, ammo stations, and lights.
*   **Splash Kit:** Starts with a water-based weapon that staggers enemies.

While the Splash Kit might seem underwhelming in solo play, it truly shines in multiplayer. Its ability to knock down and stagger large groups of enemies provides invaluable crowd control, allowing your teammates to focus on eliminating threats. It can even extinguish fire and other hazards!

*   **Pro Tip:** Coordinate Kit selection with your team to create a balanced and effective squad.

## 4. Weapon Choice: The Revolver is Your Early Game Savior

Your initial weapon options in **Firebreak** are somewhat limited. The starting arsenal includes a shotgun, a submachine gun, and a revolver. While the other weapons might feel a bit underpowered at first, the revolver stands out as a reliable choice for new players.

*   **Why the Revolver?**
    *   Deals significant damage.
    *   Can eliminate weaker enemies with one or two shots.
    *   Features a manageable reload time.

Until you've acquired enough resources to upgrade your weapons, the revolver provides the most consistent and effective damage output.

## 5. Combine Kit Powers for Maximum Impact

When hordes of Hiss enemies descend upon your squad, don't hesitate to leverage your Kit abilities. The Splash Kit and Jump Kit, in particular, have excellent synergy.

*   **The Splash and Jump Combo:**
    *   The Splash Kit user soaks enemies with water.
    *   The Jump Kit user follows up with devastating electrical shocks.

This combination can chain electricity through wet enemies, eliminating dozens of foes simultaneously. It's a powerful tactic for clearing out large groups of enemies quickly and efficiently.

## 6. Understand Altered Items and Their Potential

Altered Items are unique objects found within the Oldest House that grant special abilities or effects. These items can significantly enhance your capabilities and provide an edge in combat.

*   **Example:** The tea kettle altered item can boost the Splash Kit's firepower. However, it is not always available.

Experiment with different Altered Items to discover combinations that complement your Kit and playstyle.

## 7. Resource Management: Scavenge Wisely

The Oldest House is a dangerous place, and resources are often scarce. Effective resource management is crucial for survival.

*   **Prioritize Scavenging:**
    *   Search for ammunition, health items, and other essential supplies.
    *   Coordinate with your team to share resources and avoid hoarding.
    *   Utilize healing showers and sinks whenever possible.

## 8. Teamwork Makes the Dream Work: Stick Together!

**Firebreak** is designed as a cooperative experience. Sticking together as a team is paramount to success. Wandering off alone will quickly lead to your demise.

*   **Stay Close:**
    *   Maintain proximity to your teammates to benefit from shield and perk bonuses.
    *   Support each other in combat and provide assistance when needed.
    *   Communicate your intentions and coordinate your actions.

## 9. Learn the Enemy Patterns and Weaknesses

The Hiss and other paranatural threats in the Oldest House have distinct attack patterns and weaknesses. Learning these patterns will allow you to anticipate their attacks and exploit their vulnerabilities.

*   **Observe and Adapt:**
    *   Pay attention to enemy behavior and identify their weaknesses.
    *   Adjust your tactics and strategies based on the enemies you encounter.
    *   Communicate enemy information to your teammates.

## Conclusion: Embrace the Chaos and Conquer the Oldest House

**FBC: Firebreak** offers a challenging and rewarding cooperative experience. By following these **beginner tips**, you'll be well-equipped to survive your first shift and become a valuable member of the Firebreaker team. Remember to communicate effectively, coordinate with your squad, and adapt to the ever-changing environment of the Oldest House. Now get out there and contain those paranatural threats!
