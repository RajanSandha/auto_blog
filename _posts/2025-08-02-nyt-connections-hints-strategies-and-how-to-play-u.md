## What is NYT Connections?

Connections is a daily word game from the New York Times where you must group 16 words into four categories of four. Wyna Liu, an associate puzzle editor, is credited with bringing this engaging game to the NYT Games section.

The game is available on web browsers and mobile devices. The goal is simple: identify the hidden connections between words. But don't be fooled; it's not always as easy as it seems!

Each puzzle consists of 16 words, and your task is to find four groups of four words that share a common theme. These categories can be anything â€“ book titles, types of software, country names, or even abstract concepts. Be careful, though! Some words might seem to fit into multiple categories, but there's only one correct solution.

When you correctly identify all four words in a set, they're removed from the board. But beware of mistakes! You only get four incorrect guesses before the game ends.

To make the game even more interesting, you can rearrange the board to help you spot those elusive connections. The categories are also color-coded, with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. And just like Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media to brag about your word-sleuthing skills.

## How to Play Connections: A Quick Guide

1.  **Start with the Obvious:** Look for words that clearly belong together. These are often the 'yellow' category.
2.  **Consider Multiple Meanings:** Some words have more than one meaning. Think about all the possibilities.
3.  **Rearrange the Board:** Don't be afraid to shuffle the words around. A fresh perspective can help.
4.  **Eliminate Possibilities:** If you're stuck, try to identify words that *don't* belong together.
5.  **Don't Overthink It:** Sometimes, the solution is simpler than you think.

## Tips and Strategies for Success

*   **Look for Synonyms and Antonyms:** This is a common theme in Connections puzzles.
*   **Think Outside the Box:** The categories can be quite abstract, so be creative.
*   **Pay Attention to Word Types:** Are they nouns, verbs, adjectives? This can help you narrow down the possibilities.
*   **Use Your Mistakes Wisely:** If you make a mistake, analyze which words you incorrectly grouped together. This can provide clues.
