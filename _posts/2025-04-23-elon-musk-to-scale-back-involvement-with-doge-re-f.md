## Elon Musk to Scale Back Involvement with DOGE, Re-Focuses on Tesla Amidst Scrutiny

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has announced plans to reduce his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) starting in May. This decision comes amidst increasing scrutiny and pressure from Tesla investors, who have been urging him to dedicate more time to the electric car company, especially in light of recent sales challenges.

### A Shift in Priorities: Tesla Takes Center Stage

During a recent Tesla earnings call, Musk revealed that he intends to allocate a significant portion of his time back to Tesla. While he plans to continue dedicating "a day or two" each week to DOGE matters, "probably for the remainder of the presidentâ€™s term," his primary focus will now be on his electric car empire.

"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla, now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done," Musk stated. He emphasized his commitment to supporting DOGE "for as long as the President would like me to do so, and as long as it is useful."

### Investor Pressure and Sales Slump Fuel the Decision

Musk's role as head of DOGE has faced growing criticism, particularly from Tesla investors. They have expressed concerns that his involvement in the controversial government project is diverting his attention from the company, which is currently experiencing a significant sales slump. The pressure to prioritize Tesla's recovery seems to be a major factor in his decision to scale back his DOGE responsibilities.

### A Tumultuous Tenure at DOGE

Musk's appointment as a special advisor to the Trump administration, limited to 130 days, has been marked by controversy and skepticism. Reports have suggested that his influence within the White House has been waning, further fueling speculation about his departure from DOGE.

Rumors of Musk's imminent exit from DOGE have been circulating for weeks. Sources indicated that President Trump had been informing his inner circle that Musk would be transitioning to a more supportive role in the near future.

### Protests and Controversy Surround DOGE's Activities

Musk's involvement with DOGE has sparked a nationwide protest movement known as Tesla Takedown. Large gatherings have been taking place at Tesla showrooms and charging stations globally, with protesters expressing their discontent over government spending cuts and perceived chaos resulting from DOGE's policies.

During the Tesla earnings call, Musk acknowledged the "blowback" surrounding his role at DOGE. He attributed the protests to groups benefiting from "wasteful dollars" that DOGE aims to eliminate.

"They're obviously not going to admit that the reason that they're protesting is because they're&nbsp;receiving fraudulent money or that they're the recipients of wasteful largess," Musk stated. "But&nbsp;I don't think I can come up with some other reason."

### Claims of Success and Accusations of Misinformation

Musk has asserted that DOGE has successfully reduced "waste and fraud" within the federal government. However, these claims have been widely disputed. DOGE's "Wall of Receipts," intended to showcase successful cost-cutting measures, has been found to contain numerous errors. The *New York Times* reported that DOGE had "erased or altered more than 1,000 contracts it had claimed to cancel, representing more than 40 percent of all the contracts listed on its site."

### A Shifting Landscape: The Future of Musk's Involvement

Whether Musk will truly reduce his time commitment to DOGE remains uncertain. The situation appears to be fluid and subject to change.

"I'll have to continue doing it for the remainder of the president's term,&nbsp;just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back, which it will do if it has the chance," he said. "So I think I'll continue to spend a day or two per week&nbsp;on government matters, for as long as the President would like me to do so,&nbsp;and as long as it is useful."
