## Apple's Vision for 2027: A Mostly Glass, Curved iPhone and a Product Blitz

Apple is known for its innovation and its ability to redefine technology. Now, whispers from reliable sources suggest a potential glimpse into the company's ambitious plans for 2027, marking the 20th anniversary of the iPhone. Buckle up—2027 may bring a radical iPhone redesign, a foray into the foldable market, smart glasses, and even a home robot.

### The Glass Future: A Curved iPhone on the Horizon?

According to *Bloomberg*'s Mark Gurman, Apple is reportedly working on a “mostly glass, curved iPhone” slated for release in 2027. This suggests a significant departure from the current iPhone design language.

While current iPhones already incorporate a lot of glass, Gurman's description hints at something more radical—possibly a device dominated by seamless, continuous curves in glass.

This aligns with past rumors and patents. *The Information* referenced a 2027 model featuring a fully edge-to-edge display with an under-display camera. Meanwhile, *The Elec* noted Apple’s work with display manufacturers on bezel-less designs. A 2019 Apple patent even describes a “continuous loop” glass enclosure—offering an immersive, futuristic look.

### Beyond the iPhone: A 2027 Product Explosion

The curved glass iPhone isn’t the only headline-grabber. Gurman indicates 2027 could be a major year of product launches across Apple’s ecosystem:

#### Foldable iPhone

Apple is reportedly on track to finally debut a foldable iPhone in 2027, entering a space long-dominated by Samsung. The foldable form factor could bring powerful multitasking in a compact footprint, possibly with an Apple twist.

#### Smart Glasses

Competing with Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, Apple’s rumored AR glasses could blend wearable tech with augmented reality—offering features like heads-up notifications, navigation, and camera integration.

#### Camera-Equipped AirPods & Apple Watches

Expect AirPods and Apple Watches to gain new features too—potentially including onboard cameras for contextual awareness, enhanced health tracking, or even gesture-based interaction.

#### Home Robot with Personality

Apple may also release a tabletop AI robot assistant—described as having its own personality. This echoes previous reports of Apple’s robotic lamp prototype, aiming to provide a more human-like smart assistant experience.

### Siri Gets Smarter: LLM-Powered Assistant

At the heart of all these innovations is AI. Gurman suggests that Siri could be completely overhauled with large language model (LLM) capabilities by 2027, enabling more intelligent and contextual interactions.

To power this evolution, Apple is reportedly working on custom server-side AI chips, developed by the same Israeli team responsible for Apple Silicon. This shows a deep commitment to vertical integration and AI performance.

### Conclusion: A Transformative Year for Apple

If these leaks prove true, 2027 could be one of the most transformative years in Apple’s history. From next-gen iPhones to home robotics and AI, Apple appears poised to reshape multiple tech sectors. Whether all these products materialize remains to be seen—but the future looks bold and ambitious.
