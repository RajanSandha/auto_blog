# Sonos App Saga: A Year of Frustration, and a Promise of Redemption?

![Sonos Speaker](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25651507/_STK084_SONOS_B.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

Last year, Sonos rolled out a redesigned app, and the reaction from its user base was far from celebratory.  Instead of praise, the company faced a wave of criticism, with users complaining about missing features, poor usability, and overall frustration. Now, a year later, Sonos is still grappling with the fallout, acknowledging the issues and promising ongoing improvements. But is it enough?

## The App That Broke the Party

The initial rollout of the redesigned Sonos app in May 2024 was met with widespread negativity.  Features users had come to rely on – like seamless playlist editing, efficient queue management, and the simple convenience of alarm snoozing – were inexplicably absent.  This sparked a considerable backlash, with many users voicing their displeasure on social media and online forums.  The situation quickly escalated, with the app becoming a focal point of negative press and a symbol of a company seemingly out of touch with its customer base.

## Sonos Responds: A Long and Winding Road to Redemption

Sonos, to its credit, hasn't ignored the outcry.  Chief Innovation Officer Nick Millington, the original architect of the Sonos system, has taken the reins of the app's recovery, issuing several public updates detailing the company's efforts to rectify the situation.  In his latest statement, Millington emphasized a two-pronged approach:

### 1. Understanding the Root Cause

Millington's commitment is clear: the team is dedicated to understanding every single user issue, no matter how seemingly minor.  This focus on granular analysis aims to identify the core problems plaguing the app and develop targeted solutions.  The team's approach suggests a move away from superficial fixes towards a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying technological issues.

### 2. Restoring Functionality and Usability

The second priority is equally important: bringing back the missing features that users valued in the previous version of the app.  Millington highlights that this process is being tackled in a prioritized manner, based on user feedback. This implies a commitment to addressing the most pressing concerns first, offering a sense of progress and transparency to frustrated users.

## Progress, But Still a Long Way to Go

While Millington's updates offer a degree of reassurance, the reality is that the app's issues remain.  While some features, such as alarm snoozing and improved battery monitoring for portable speakers, have been reintroduced, crucial elements are still missing.  Playlist editing and the ability to queue entire folders from a local library remain absent, with only a promise of their return in “upcoming releases”. This slow pace of improvement fuels ongoing frustration among users.

## What's Next for the Sonos App?

The situation highlights a critical lesson for tech companies: a significant app redesign shouldn't come at the expense of core functionality and user experience.  Sonos's response, while seemingly sincere, has been slow, leaving users to grapple with a subpar experience for an extended period.  The question remains: can Sonos regain the trust of its users and deliver on its promises?  The success of this recovery will depend not only on the speed of future updates but also on the quality of those updates. Will the restored features truly meet user expectations, or will further issues emerge?

The success or failure of this undertaking will have significant implications for Sonos's reputation and future.  A continued struggle with the app could damage the brand's image and potentially drive customers to competitors.  Conversely, a successful turnaround could solidify Sonos's position as a leader in the premium home audio market.

## The Verdict: Hope Remains, But Patience is Wearing Thin

Sonos's commitment to addressing the issues with its app is commendable.  However, the extended period of frustration experienced by users underscores the need for more agile development and a more user-centric approach.  While the company’s public statements offer a glimmer of hope, the proof will be in the pudding – or rather, in the upcoming app updates.  Only time will tell if Sonos can truly restore its app to its former glory and regain the trust of its disappointed customers.
