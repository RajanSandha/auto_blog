### Where to Watch in the US

For viewers in the United States, the game will be broadcast on **FOX**. If you have cable, you're all set! But what if you're a cord-cutter? Don't worry; you have several options:

*   **Over-the-Air Antenna:** The most budget-friendly option! Connect an antenna to your TV to watch via your local Fox station.
*   **Fox Website:** Stream directly on the Fox website if you're watching on a PC, phone, or tablet.
*   **Live TV Streaming Services:** These services offer free trials, so you can test them out before committing. However, make sure they carry your local Fox station! Here are a few popular choices:
    *   **Sling TV Blue:** Costs $46 a month and includes local Fox stations in select markets. [Check out Sling TV](https://www.sling.com/).
    *   **YouTube TV:** Costs $83 a month and includes Fox in most markets. Enter your ZIP code on their website to confirm local channel availability. [Check out YouTube TV](https://tv.youtube.com/).

### Watching from Anywhere: VPNs to the Rescue

Traveling abroad? Or maybe the game isn't available in your region? A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** can help! A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, protecting your privacy and allowing you to access content as if you were in another location.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Legality:** VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada.
*   **Terms of Service:** Some streaming services may restrict VPN use. Always check the platform's terms of service.
*   **Security:** Choose a reputable VPN provider to ensure your data is protected.

**Our Recommendation:**

[ExpressVPN is a reliable choice.]

**ExpressVPN** is a top-rated VPN known for its speed, security, and ease of use. It has servers in 105 countries, allowing you to connect from almost anywhere. They also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it risk-free. [Check out ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/).

### Global Broadcast Options

*   **UK:** Premier Sports has the broadcast rights. The game will be shown live on Premier Sports 2 and Premier Sports Player. A full subscription costs £10 per month for Sky and Virgin TV customers or £15 a month as an add-on through Amazon Prime Video. [Check out Premier Sports](https://www.premiersports.com/).
*   **Canada:** FuboTV Canada and TSN are your go-to options. [Check out FuboTV Canada](https://www.fubo.tv/ca/). [Check out TSN](https://www.tsn.ca/).

### Key Takeaways & Actionable Tips

*   **Plan Ahead:** Decide which streaming service or VPN you'll use before the game starts to avoid last-minute scrambling.
*   **Check Local Listings:** Confirm that your chosen service carries your local Fox station (if you're in the US).
*   **Test Your VPN:** If using a VPN, test it before the game to ensure it's working correctly and that you can access the stream.
*   **Set a Reminder:** With varying kickoff times across different time zones, set a reminder so you don't miss the start of the match.

    *   Yes, in many countries, including the US and Canada. However, some streaming services may have policies against VPN use.
*   **What if my streaming service blocks VPNs?**
    *   Try a different VPN server or contact your VPN provider for assistance.
*   **What's the cheapest way to watch the game in the US?**
    *   Using an over-the-air antenna to watch via your local Fox station is the most cost-effective option.
