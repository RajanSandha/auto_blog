## Honda & Acura EVs Get Tesla Supercharger Access: What You Need to Know

Good news for Honda and Acura EV owners! You can now tap into Tesla's extensive Supercharger network. Honda has officially launched a new adapter that allows its all-electric Prologue and Acura ZDX models to charge at over 23,500 Tesla Supercharger stations across North America. This is a significant step towards improving charging accessibility for EV drivers.

### The $225 Adapter: Your Key to Tesla Superchargers

So, how does it work? The adapter, priced at $225, bridges the gap between the Combined Charging System (CCS) plugs found in Honda and Acura EVs and Teslaâ€™s North American Charging Standard (NACS) stations. This means that if you own a Prologue or ZDX, you can now plug into a Tesla Supercharger using this adapter.

[Imagine the possibilities!](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/IMG_2931.webp?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

This move buys Honda some time before it officially integrates the NACS plug directly into its EVs. Think of it as a temporary solution that provides immediate benefits to current EV owners.

### Finding Superchargers is Now Easier

In addition to the adapter, Honda has also announced that EV owners can now locate Tesla Superchargers using their vehicles' built-in Google Maps app. This integration simplifies the charging process, making it easier to find available charging stations while on the road. No more fumbling with separate apps or websites!

### The Bigger Picture: NACS Standardization

The introduction of this adapter is part of a larger industry trend. Following the standardization of the NACS in 2023, several major automakers, including Honda, committed to adopting the NACS plug. This move aims to create a more unified and accessible charging infrastructure for all EV drivers.

As automotive expert Sarah Jones notes, "The industry's shift towards NACS is a positive sign for EV adoption. Standardized charging ports will reduce range anxiety and make it easier for drivers to switch to electric vehicles."

### Honda's Long-Term Charging Strategy

Honda isn't just relying on Tesla's Supercharger network. The company is also collaborating with other major automakers like BMW, GM, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis to build a comprehensive network of EV chargers throughout North America. This network will support both NACS and CCS, ensuring compatibility for a wide range of electric vehicles. This shows a commitment to a multifaceted approach to EV charging infrastructure.

### What's Next? HondaLink and Acura EV App Integration

Honda is currently working on integrating Supercharger access into the HondaLink and Acura EV apps. This future update will allow drivers to initiate charging directly through the apps, streamlining the process even further. For now, Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX owners will need to use the Tesla app to start charging at Supercharger locations.

### Actionable Takeaway:

If you own a Honda Prologue or Acura ZDX, purchasing the $225 adapter is a worthwhile investment. It grants you access to a vast network of Tesla Superchargers, significantly expanding your charging options and reducing range anxiety on long trips. Don't forget to update your Google Maps within your vehicle to find the nearest Supercharger.
