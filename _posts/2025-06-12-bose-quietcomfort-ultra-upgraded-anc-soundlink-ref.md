## Bose QuietComfort Ultra: Next-Level ANC and a SoundLink Refresh! 

Bose is back at it again, this time with a significant upgrade to their popular QuietComfort line and a revamped SoundLink series. Get ready for the **Bose QuietComfort Ultra** earbuds, boasting enhanced adaptive Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), and the updated **SoundLink Micro** and brand-new **SoundLink Plus** Bluetooth speakers. Let's dive into what makes these new releases so exciting for audiophiles and everyday listeners alike.

### QuietComfort Ultra: Smarter Noise Cancellation

The headline feature of the QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) earbuds is undoubtedly the improved adaptive ANC. Bose promises a smoother, more natural response to sudden changes in ambient noise. Imagine walking down a busy street and a siren blares by â€“ instead of a jarring shift in noise cancellation, the QuietComfort Ultra will gradually increase the ANC level, minimizing disruption to your listening experience. This is achieved through an updated **AI algorithm** that refines the ANC adjustments, especially when using awareness mode.

*   **Adaptive ANC:** Reacts smoothly to sudden noises. 
*   **AI-Powered:** Subtler ANC adjustments for a natural listening experience.
*   **Personalized Audio:** Carries over the original version's calibration technology, adapting audio and ANC to your ear shape.

These earbuds are expected to hit Bose's online store later this summer, priced at $299. You'll have your choice of black, white smoke, and a stylish deep plum color.

### Call Quality and Convenience

Beyond the enhanced ANC, Bose has also focused on improving call quality. Drawing on technology initially developed for hearing aids, the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds are designed to reduce background noise during calls, such as wind or office chatter. This ensures your voice comes through clearly, even in noisy environments.

Furthermore, the new earbuds include several user-friendly features:

*   **Improved Call Quality:** Background noise reduction for clearer calls.
*   **Wireless Charging:** The charging case can now be charged wirelessly.
*   **Wax Guard:** A new guard reduces wax buildup and simplifies cleaning.
*   **Disable Touch Controls:** Option to disable capacitive touch controls to prevent accidental inputs.
*   **Same Great Battery Life:** Up to 24 hours of listening time with the charging case.

### SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen): Small Speaker, Big Upgrades

The SoundLink Micro Bluetooth speaker is also getting a refresh. The 2nd generation model, expected later this summer for $129, brings some welcome improvements to this ultra-portable speaker.

The most notable upgrade is the switch to a **USB-C charging port**, a welcome change for modern convenience. But the upgrades don't stop there:

*   **USB-C Charging:** Modern and convenient charging.
*   **Doubled Battery Life:** Increased from 6 to 12 hours.
*   **Improved Sound:** Clearer sound at higher frequencies.
*   **Bose App Compatibility:** Customize button functions and adjust the sound profile using an EQ.

Available in black and blue dusk, the SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen) is the perfect companion for outdoor adventures or simply enjoying music on the go. The doubled battery life is a significant improvement, making it an even more compelling option.

### SoundLink Plus: A New Premium Portable Speaker

Bose is also introducing an entirely new portable Bluetooth speaker: the **SoundLink Plus**. This premium offering, launching on June 26th and available for preorder now at $269, aims to deliver exceptional sound quality in a portable package.

The SoundLink Plus boasts a powerful audio setup:

*   **Subwoofer and Tweeter:** For a rich, full sound.
*   **Four Passive Radiators:** Enhanced bass response.
*   **20-Hour Battery Life:** Enjoy music all day long.
*   **IP67 Waterproof Rating:** Submersible up to a few feet for 30 minutes and it floats.

The IP67 waterproof rating ensures the SoundLink Plus can withstand the elements, making it ideal for pool parties, beach trips, or any outdoor activity where water might be a concern. The fact that it floats is a huge plus!

Pre-orders are available in black and blue dusk, with a citrus yellow option arriving on June 18th. If you're looking for a premium portable speaker that delivers both exceptional sound and durability, the SoundLink Plus is definitely worth considering.

### The Future of Sound with Bose

Bose's latest announcements demonstrate their commitment to innovation and improving the listening experience. The upgraded **adaptive ANC** in the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, the enhanced SoundLink Micro, and the all-new SoundLink Plus speaker showcase Bose's dedication to pushing the boundaries of audio technology. Whether you're seeking immersive noise cancellation, portable convenience, or premium sound quality, Bose has something new to offer. Keep an eye out for these releases later this summer!
