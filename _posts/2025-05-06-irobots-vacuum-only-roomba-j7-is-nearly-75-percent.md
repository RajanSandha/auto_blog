### Why the Roomba j7?

The Roomba j7 was previously *The Verge's* top pick for robot vacuums, and for good reason. It's a streamlined version of the j7 Plus (auto-empty base) and the Combo j7 Plus (adds mopping, sensors, larger battery). While it doesnâ€™t have all the extras, it offers excellent cleaning power and smart features at an unbeatable price.
