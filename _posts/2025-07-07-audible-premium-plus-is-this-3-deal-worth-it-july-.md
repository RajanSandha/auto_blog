Prime Day might be over, but some deals linger! Audible, Amazon's audiobook and podcast service, is offering a tempting deal for new subscribers. But is it right for you?

This blog post breaks down the Audible Premium Plus offer, explores its value, and helps you decide if it’s a worthwhile investment.

## What's the Audible Premium Plus Deal?

For a limited time, new Audible subscribers can snag three months of Audible Premium Plus for just $3. This is a significant discount compared to the regular price of $14.99 per month, saving you a total of $42.

**Here’s the catch:** This offer is valid for new subscribers only. If you've had an Audible subscription in the past, you likely won't be eligible.

## What Do You Get with Audible Premium Plus?

Audible Premium Plus is the service's top-tier subscription. It unlocks a range of benefits:

*   **One Credit Per Month:** Each month, you receive one credit that can be used to purchase any audiobook in the Audible library, regardless of price.
*   **Keep Your Audiobooks Forever:** Even if you cancel your subscription, the audiobooks you purchased with credits are yours to keep.
*   **Access to the Plus Catalog:** Enjoy unlimited listening to thousands of audiobooks, podcasts, and Audible Originals within the Plus Catalog.
*   **Exclusive Discounts:** Members get access to exclusive sales and discounts on audiobooks.

## Is Audible Premium Plus Worth It for $3?

Absolutely, if you're a new subscriber and enjoy audiobooks or podcasts! Even if you only listen to the three audiobooks you acquire with your credits, you're paying just $1 per book – a steal compared to their individual prices.
