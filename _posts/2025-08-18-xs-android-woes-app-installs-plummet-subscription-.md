## X's Android Woes: App Installs Plummet & Subscription Revenue Dips

Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) is facing a tough situation on Android, with app installs significantly declining year-over-year. While iOS downloads are showing positive growth, the Android numbers paint a concerning picture, potentially impacting subscription revenue. Let's dive into the details and explore what might be happening.

### The Android App Download Decline

According to data from Appfigures, X downloads on Google Play experienced a sharp drop in July 2025. New installs decreased by a substantial 44% compared to the previous year, even as iOS downloads increased by 15%. This disparity is dragging down X's overall mobile download numbers, resulting in a 26% year-over-year decrease in total downloads as of July.

This follows a similar trend from June 2025, where total downloads had already fallen by 35%, largely due to a nearly 49% drop in Android downloads. The consistent decline suggests a deeper issue affecting X's performance on the Android platform.

### What's Causing the Android Dip?

While Appfigures hasn't pinpointed the exact cause, they suggest that the X app on Android has a reputation for being problematic. The app is often described as buggy and prone to crashes, leading to a less-than-ideal user experience. This negative perception could be deterring potential users from downloading the app and existing users from continuing to use it.

### X's Response: The "Android Dream Team"

X seems to be aware of the issue. Nikita Bier, X's Head of Product, has acknowledged the problems and hinted at efforts to improve the Android app. Bier even announced the formation of an "Android Dream Team" dedicated to rebuilding the X Android app from the ground up. This suggests that X is taking the Android issue seriously and is committed to addressing the problems.

Bier also highlighted that X's iOS app recently had a record week in terms of installs, perhaps in an attempt to offset the negative news surrounding the Android app.

### Where Are Android Users Going?

The question remains: where are potential X Android users going instead? While rival platform Bluesky has experienced slowing growth, its Google Play app downloads are nowhere near the scale of X. Meta's Threads, however, is catching up to X in terms of daily active users on mobile devices. It's possible that some Android users are migrating to Threads as an alternative.

### Impact on Subscription Revenue

The decline in Android downloads isn't the only challenge X is facing. The company is also struggling to grow its subscription revenue. In July 2025, X earned $16.9 million in net revenue, down from $18.8 million in March 2025. While there was a slight increase from June's $16.8 million, the overall trend suggests a decline.

While X primarily relies on ad revenue, subscription revenue is still an important source of income. The declining demand for X on Android likely contributes to the revenue dip. Additionally, X may be losing paying customers to Grok, which now has its own standalone app and attracts users who subscribed to X primarily for AI features.

### Key Takeaways

*   X is experiencing a significant decline in Android app installs, potentially due to the app's reputation for being buggy and unstable.
*   This decline is impacting overall mobile downloads and potentially contributing to a decrease in subscription revenue.
*   X is aware of the issue and has formed an "Android Dream Team" to rebuild the Android app.
*   Some Android users may be migrating to alternative platforms like Threads.
*   X is also facing competition from Grok, which offers similar AI features to X's premium subscriptions.

**Actionable Tip:** If you're an Android user experiencing issues with the X app, consider providing feedback to X through official channels (e.g., the app store review section or X's support channels). Your feedback can help X prioritize and address the most pressing issues.
