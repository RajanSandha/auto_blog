# DreamCloud Premier Mattress Review: Hotel Luxury at an Affordable Price

Buying a new mattress can feel overwhelming. Memory foam or hybrid? What's the right budget? Does a higher price *really* mean a better night's sleep? And let's face it, you're going to be sleeping on this thing for the next decade! The stakes are high.

[DreamCloud](https://www.dreamcloudsleep.com/) promises high-quality comfort and support at prices that undercut many competitors. The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid, their most popular mattress, piqued my interest because you can often find a queen-size for under $1000. That's a steal compared to other luxury hybrid options.

After sleeping on the DreamCloud Premier for a month, I can honestly say it's the closest I've come to experiencing hotel-level luxury in my own bedroom. Let's dive into why.

## First Impressions: Hassle-Free Setup

Believe it or not, mattresses come with instructions! DreamCloud actually *emailed* instructions days before delivery, which was a welcome change. They advised having someone on hand to help with the 90-pound mattress and assured me a brochure would be included for unboxing and care.

The unboxing process was incredibly easy. A single cut into the plastic, and the mattress expanded quickly. DreamCloud states the Premier Hybrid is 13 inches high, which feels just right – not too high, not too low. Within minutes, it reached almost its full height.

## The Initial Smell (and How to Handle It)

DreamCloud says you can sleep on the mattress the same night it's unboxed, but I opted to let it air out. This isn't the recommended method as it requires moving the fully expanded mattress later. However, it gave me a chance to assess the off-gassing.

There was a slight chemical smell initially, not offensive but noticeable. If you're sensitive to smells, this might bother you. After three days, the scent was completely gone.

**Actionable Tip:** If you're sensitive to smells, unbox your DreamCloud Premier in a well-ventilated room a few days before you plan to sleep on it.

## Decoding the Layers: Support and Comfort

The DreamCloud Premier is a hybrid mattress, meaning it combines memory foam and innerspring coils. Here's a breakdown of the layers:

*   **Quilted Euro Top:** Includes cooling fibers for temperature regulation.
*   **Memory Foam Layer:** Provides pressure relief.
*   **Adaptive Foam Layer:** Offers ergonomic support.
*   **8-inch Innerspring Coil Layer:** Individually wrapped coils for solid support and reinforced edges.
*   **Dense Foam Layer:** Provides stability.

In total, that's four layers of support beneath a quilted cover!

## How Does the DreamCloud Premier Hybrid *Feel*?

The quilted cover is fantastic – it feels luxurious and provides initial pressure relief without that sinking feeling. It's a cushioned sleeping-on-top-of-the-mattress experience, not a sinking-into-the-mattress one.

The mattress offers excellent support. I felt supported in all sleeping positions (back, side, and stomach). The medium-firm feel is ideal for a wide range of sleepers. I didn't experience any back pain or stiffness during my testing period.

## Hotel-Like Luxury: What Makes It Special?

So, what gives the DreamCloud Premier that hotel-like feel? It's a combination of factors:

*   **The Quilted Cover:** As mentioned, it's incredibly comfortable and luxurious.
*   **The Hybrid Construction:** The combination of memory foam and innerspring coils provides the perfect balance of comfort and support.
*   **The Edge Support:** The reinforced edges prevent that rolling-off-the-bed feeling.
*   **The Temperature Regulation:** The cooling fibers in the cover help to keep you cool throughout the night.

## Who is the DreamCloud Premier Best For?

Based on my experience, the DreamCloud Premier Hybrid is an excellent choice for:

*   **Combination Sleepers:** Those who switch positions throughout the night.
*   **Couples:** The excellent motion isolation minimizes disturbance from a partner's movements.
*   **Those Seeking Luxury at an Affordable Price:** You get a premium feel without breaking the bank.
*   **People who prefer a Medium-Firm Feel:** It's not too soft, not too firm – just right for many.

## Potential Downsides

*   **Initial Smell:** As mentioned, there's a slight chemical smell that dissipates after a few days.
*   **Weight:** It's a heavy mattress, so you'll need help moving it.

## Is the DreamCloud Premier Worth It?

Absolutely. For under $1000 (queen size, when on sale), the DreamCloud Premier Hybrid delivers a level of comfort and support that rivals much more expensive mattresses. It's a fantastic value and a great way to upgrade your sleep experience.

## FAQ About the DreamCloud Premier Mattress

*   **What is the firmness level of the DreamCloud Premier?** It's considered medium-firm, around a 6.5 out of 10 on the firmness scale.
*   **Does the DreamCloud Premier sleep hot?** No, the cooling fibers in the cover help to regulate temperature.
*   **What is the trial period and warranty?** DreamCloud offers a 365-night trial and a lifetime warranty.
*   **Does it have good edge support?** Yes, the reinforced edges provide excellent edge support.

## Key Takeaways

*   The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid mattress offers hotel-like luxury at an affordable price.
*   Its hybrid construction provides a balance of comfort and support.
*   The quilted cover and cooling fibers enhance the sleeping experience.
*   Be aware of a slight initial smell that dissipates quickly.
