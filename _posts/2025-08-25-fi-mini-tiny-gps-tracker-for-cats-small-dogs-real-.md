## What is the Fi Mini?

The Fi Mini is a clip-on GPS tracker that's incredibly lightweight, weighing only 0.56 ounces (16 grams). It's designed to be small and unobtrusive, perfect for cats and small dogs who might find larger trackers uncomfortable. With the Fi Mini, you can monitor your pet's location using the accompanying app, receiving alerts if they escape their designated safe zone.
