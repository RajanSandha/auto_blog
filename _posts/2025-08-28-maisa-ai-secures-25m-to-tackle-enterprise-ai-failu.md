## Maisa AI Secures $25M to Tackle Enterprise AI Failure Rates

Are enterprise AI projects failing at an alarming rate? A recent MIT report suggests that a staggering 95% of generative AI pilots are not making the cut. But don't lose hope just yet! Maisa AI is stepping up to the plate with a fresh approach and a hefty $25 million seed round to back it up.

Maisa AI believes the key to successful enterprise automation lies in **accountable AI agents**, not the mysterious "black boxes" that often lead to project failures. Let's dive into how they plan to turn the tide.

### The Problem: Why Are Enterprise AI Projects Failing?

According to MIT's NANDA initiative, the failure rate of generative AI pilots within companies is a whopping 95%. This isn't just a minor setback; it's a major hurdle for organizations looking to leverage the power of AI.

So, what's going wrong?

*   **Lack of Accountability:** Many AI systems operate as opaque "black boxes," making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their conclusions. This lack of transparency can erode trust and hinder adoption.
*   **Hallucinations:** AI models can sometimes generate inaccurate or nonsensical information, a phenomenon known as "hallucinations." This can be a major problem when AI is used for critical tasks.
*   **Difficulties in Reviewing AI Work:** It's simply not feasible for humans to thoroughly review large amounts of work done by AI in a short amount of time. This creates a bottleneck and makes it difficult to ensure accuracy and compliance.

### Maisa AI's Solution: Accountable AI Agents

Maisa AI is taking a different approach. Their platform, **Maisa Studio**, is designed to help users deploy digital workers that can be trained using natural language. These digital workers are built on the principle of accountability, ensuring that their actions are transparent and understandable.

Instead of focusing solely on generating responses, Maisa AI uses AI to build the **process** required to arrive at the response. This "chain-of-work" approach allows for greater control and auditability.

### Introducing HALP: Human-Augmented LLM Processing

To address the issue of AI "hallucinations" and ensure accountability, Maisa AI employs a system called HALP (Human-Augmented LLM Processing). Think of it like students at a blackboard: HALP prompts users to define their needs, while the digital workers outline each step they will follow.

This collaborative approach ensures that humans remain in the loop, providing guidance and oversight to the AI system. It also helps to build trust and confidence in the AI's output.

### The Knowledge Processing Unit (KPU): Limiting Hallucinations

Maisa AI has also developed the Knowledge Processing Unit (KPU), a deterministic system designed to limit hallucinations. By providing a structured and controlled environment for AI processing, the KPU helps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the AI's output.

### Maisa Studio: Empowering Non-Technical Users

One of the key goals of Maisa Studio is to empower non-technical users to leverage the power of AI. The platform's self-serve interface and natural language training capabilities make it easy for anyone to create and deploy digital workers.

This accessibility is crucial for driving wider adoption of AI within organizations and unlocking its full potential.

### Real-World Applications

Maisa AI is already being used by a large bank, as well as companies in the car manufacturing and energy sectors. These clients are leveraging Maisa AI to automate critical tasks and improve productivity.

By focusing on complex use cases that demand accountability, Maisa AI is positioning itself as a leader in the enterprise AI space.

### Funding and Future Plans

With its recent $25 million seed round, Maisa AI plans to expand its team and meet the growing demand for its platform. The company anticipates rapid growth in the coming months as it begins serving its waiting list.

Maisa AI's dual headquarters in Valencia and San Francisco give it a strong foothold in both the European and U.S. markets.

### Key Takeaways

*   Enterprise AI projects are failing at a high rate due to issues like lack of accountability and hallucinations.
*   Maisa AI offers a solution with its accountable AI agents and the Maisa Studio platform.
*   HALP and the KPU are key components of Maisa AI's approach to ensuring accuracy and reliability.
*   Maisa AI is targeting complex use cases in regulated industries.
*   The company plans to use its funding to expand its team and meet growing demand.

### Actionable Tip

If you're struggling to implement AI in your organization, consider focusing on **accountability and transparency**. Look for solutions that provide clear explanations of how AI systems arrive at their conclusions and ensure that humans remain in the loop for critical decision-making.
