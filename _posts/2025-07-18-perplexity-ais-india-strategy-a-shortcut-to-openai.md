## Perplexity AI's India Strategy: A Shortcut to OpenAI's Lead?

Perplexity AI is making a bold move to challenge OpenAI's dominance in the AI space. While OpenAI has focused on solidifying its position in the US market, Perplexity is quietly expanding into India, aiming to capitalize on the next wave of AI adoption.

Why India? The country offers a massive, tech-savvy user base and a relatively untapped market for AI-powered search. Let's dive into Perplexity's strategy and its potential impact.

### India: A Strategic Battlefield for AI Supremacy

India, the world's most populous nation, presents a unique opportunity for AI companies. With a rapidly growing smartphone and internet user base, the country is a prime target for mass-market adoption of AI technologies. Perplexity recognizes this potential and is strategically positioning itself to capture a significant share of the Indian market.

### The Airtel Partnership: A Game Changer?

Perplexity's recent partnership with Bharti Airtel, India's second-largest telecom operator, is a significant step in its expansion strategy. This deal offers a free 12-month Perplexity Pro subscription, normally valued at $200, to all 360 million Airtel subscribers. This exclusive partnership gives Perplexity a massive reach and a competitive edge over other AI platforms in India.

According to Airtel, this is an exclusive deal, meaning no other telecom operator in India can offer Perplexity's services, including free access, to their subscribers.

### Global Expansion with a Focus on India

The Airtel partnership is part of Perplexity's broader global expansion strategy, which includes collaborations with over 25 telecom operators worldwide, including SoftBank in Japan and SK Telecom in South Korea. However, India stands out due to its sheer size and potential for rapid growth.

### Impressive Growth Metrics in India

Perplexity is already witnessing significant traction in India. According to data from Sensor Tower, Perplexity's downloads in India surged by 600% year-over-year in Q2, reaching 2.8 million. While OpenAI's ChatGPT also experienced substantial growth (587% increase, reaching 46.7 million downloads), Perplexity's growth rate is noteworthy.

Monthly active users (MAUs) also paint a positive picture for Perplexity. In Q2, Perplexity's MAUs in India increased by 640% year-over-year, while ChatGPT's MAUs grew by 350%. India was Perplexity's largest market by MAUs in the last quarter, although ChatGPT still holds a significant lead in absolute numbers (19.8 million MAUs versus 3.7 million for Perplexity).

### Leveraging Partnerships for Growth

In addition to the Airtel deal, Perplexity has also partnered with Indian fintech giant Paytm to integrate its AI-powered search into the Paytm app, which boasts over 500 million downloads. This collaboration provides Perplexity with access to a vast user base and strengthens its presence in the Indian market.

### Why India? A Market Ripe for Disruption

Perplexity sees India as a key growth market due to the relatively limited number of local AI startups, particularly in the AI search space. This, coupled with a large and active base of tech-savvy users, makes India an ideal environment for Perplexity to thrive. Even Google has recognized the potential of the Indian market, launching AI-powered search features like AI Mode and AI Overviews in India before many other markets.

### The Monetization Challenge

While Perplexity is experiencing impressive user growth in India, monetizing that user base remains a challenge. The Indian market is known for its price sensitivity, and Perplexity currently lags behind ChatGPT in terms of revenue. In Q2, ChatGPT's in-app purchase revenue worldwide surged by 731% year-over-year to $773 million, while Perplexity saw a 300% increase, reaching $8 million.

However, there are promising signs. ChatGPT witnessed an 800% year-over-year increase in in-app purchases in India, reaching $9 million in Q2. Perplexity has not yet generated significant in-app revenue from India, but the startup has ample room to expand its paid subscriber base through strategic partnerships like the one with Airtel.

### The Road Ahead: Converting Users into Revenue

Strategic partnerships in markets like India could help Perplexity attract the attention of investors who value user growth and geographic diversification. However, to secure long-term backing, Perplexity will need to demonstrate its ability to convert its expanding user base into revenue.

### Actionable Takeaway

For businesses looking to expand into emerging markets, Perplexity's strategy offers valuable lessons. **Focus on strategic partnerships to gain access to a large user base, adapt your pricing to local market conditions, and prioritize user growth as a key indicator of future success.**
