## College on a Budget: Top Tech Gadgets Under $50 for Students

Heading back to campus? You've probably got the textbooks and the dorm essentials covered. But what about those little tech gadgets that can make student life so much easier? We're talking about things like extra chargers, portable battery packs, and reliable earbuds. These might seem like small things, but they can make a huge difference in how you work and play. This guide highlights the best gadgets for students under $50, so you can ace this semester without breaking the bank.

### The Importance of Budget-Friendly Tech for Students

College life can be expensive. Tuition, books, housing – the costs add up quickly. That's why finding affordable tech solutions is so important for students. These gadgets can improve productivity, enhance entertainment, and make everyday tasks more convenient, all without putting a strain on your wallet. Plus, with a little planning, you can find some pretty awesome deals.

### Must-Have Tech Gadgets for Students Under $50

Here's a curated list of essential tech gadgets that every student should consider, all priced under $50:

*   **Bluetooth Tracker:** Never lose your keys, wallet, or backpack again with a Bluetooth tracker like the Chipolo Pop. 
*   **Compact Wireless Keyboard:** Save space and improve your typing experience with a compact wireless keyboard like the Logitech Pop Icon Keys.
*   **Portable Speaker:** Enjoy music on the go with a portable speaker like the JBL Go 4. 
*   **Laptop Sleeve:** Protect your laptop from bumps and scratches with a protective laptop sleeve like the Tomtoc 360°.
*   **Streaming Stick:** Upgrade your TV experience with a streaming stick like the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD.

### In-Depth Look at Recommended Gadgets

Let's dive deeper into some of these top picks:

#### Chipolo Pop: The Ultimate Bluetooth Tracker



A Bluetooth tracker is an essential piece of tech for students. The Chipolo Pop is a great option. The latest model can tap into a larger finding network by utilizing those of both Google and Apple, so it can more easily pinpoint the location of their lost things. Its ping is louder than an AirTag, too, which should make it even easier for them to find their bag, backpack, wallet or anything else they’ve lost when they believe it’s close by. And unlike an AirTag, the Pop has a built-in keyring hole so they can simply slide it onto their keychain and forget about it. Regardless of if the student in your life is prone to losing things, the Chipolo Pop will give them peace of mind knowing they’ll always be able to find their belongings.

#### Logitech Pop Icon Keys Wireless Keyboard: Compact and Stylish

Students may not have a lot of space to spare on their desks or in their dorm rooms, but there’s probably enough space for the Logitech Pop Icon Keys. It’s a compact keyboard that is one of our top picks for the best keyboards thanks to its attractive design, customizable action buttons and long battery life. Even if your student doesn’t have an external monitor or big computer setup, a Bluetooth keyboard like this one can improve their ergonomics overall and prevent them from slouching and slumping for hours over their laptop. The customizable, right-side action buttons are a great touch, allowing them to program frequently-used shortcuts for easier and quicker access. And in addition to coming in a few fun colors, the Pop Icon Keys can connect to three devices simultaneously and can last up to three years on a single pair of AAA batteries (depending on usage, of course).

#### JBL Go 4: Portable Sound Powerhouse

You can’t go wrong gifting a student a portable speaker. Chances are, they probably use their phone as their main speaker when they want to have an impromptu tiny desk concert or when they’re hanging out with friends. But a dedicated speaker will provide much better performance, even one as affordable as the JBL Go 4. This palm-sized speaker packs a punch with loud sound and decent bass for a device of its size. It’ll be almost too easy for them to pair the Go 4 with their smartphone, tablet or laptop and they can take it pretty much anywhere thanks to its compact design and the fact that it’s IP67 waterproof and dustproof. The built-in carrying loop is a nice touch as well, allowing them to use a clip or carabineer to attach the speaker to a backpack or bike while they’re out and about.

#### Tomtoc 360° Protective Laptop Sleeve: Safeguard Your Investment



You don’t have to go all-out and gift your favorite student a new laptop, but you can help them protect the one they already have. The Tomtoc 360 protective laptop case is a great option that works with MacBooks, Windows laptops and Chromebooks — just be sure to get the right size to fit your student’s machine. The case has thick edges that absorb impacts from drops and bumps, and the exterior is spill-resistant as well. The exterior zipper pocket will allow them to easily carry a charging brick and cable with them wherever they go, and there’s a built-in strap inside of it to which they could attach a Bluetooth tracker or their keys for safe keeping. There’s also nearly a dozen colors to choose from, so you’re bound to find one that suits your student’s tastes.

#### Amazon Fire TV Stick HD: Transform Any TV into a Smart TV

If you’re unsure of your student’s TV situation, or know they don’t have the cash to buy a brand new set, get them the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD. It’s an easy way for them to upgrade their streaming experience using whatever TV they already have thanks to its ability to stream content at 1080p/60 fps. Amazon updated this model at the end of 2024 and fixed our major issue with the previous streaming stick: the included remote can now control

### Actionable Takeaway: Prioritize Protection

Before splurging on the latest gadgets, invest in a good quality laptop sleeve or bag. A damaged laptop can set you back hundreds of dollars, making a protective case a worthwhile investment.
