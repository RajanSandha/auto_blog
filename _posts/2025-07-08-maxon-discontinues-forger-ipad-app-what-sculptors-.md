## Maxon Discontinues Forger iPad App: What Sculptors Need to Know

Maxon, a leading developer of professional 3D modeling and animation software, has announced that it is sunsetting its **Forger** sculpting app for iPad. This news might be disappointing for users who have relied on Forger for their digital sculpting needs. But don't worry, we'll break down what this means for you and explore alternative options.

[Maxon](https://www.maxon.net/) is shifting its focus to the more comprehensive ZBrush iPadOS app, which was introduced last year. This decision marks the end of an era for Forger, one of the earliest and most popular sculpting apps on the iPad.

### What's Happening to Forger?

*   **Removal from App Store:** Forger will be removed from the App Store on September 10th.
*   **Limited Maintenance Mode:** The app will enter a "Limited Maintenance Mode," meaning no future updates, bug fixes, or changes will be implemented.
*   **Continued Use:** Existing users can continue using Forger after support ends.
*   **Subscription Renewals:** Subscription licenses for Forger ($14 annually) can be renewed until September 10th and will be valid until the end of the subscription term.

### Why is Maxon Discontinuing Forger?

Maxon states that this decision was made to consolidate resources and enhance the sculpting experience on iPad. By focusing on **ZBrush**, they aim to leverage Forger's history and ZBrush's advanced capabilities to introduce more features and innovations, especially with the Apple Pencil and iPad.

> "We carefully considered this decision. Our goal is to consolidate resources and efforts to enhance the sculpting experience on iPad," Maxon explains. "By merging our teams, we can leverage Forger's history on iPad and ZBrush's sculpting capabilities to introduce more features and innovations, particularly with the Apple Pencil and iPad."

### Transitioning to ZBrush for iPad

Maxon encourages Forger users to transition to the iPad version of ZBrush, which launched in September 2024. While both apps have free-to-use tiers with basic tools, premium features require a subscription.

*   **ZBrush Benefits:** ZBrush offers a wider range of tools and functionality compared to Forger.
*   **ZBrush Cost:** ZBrush is significantly more expensive at $89.99 per year.
*   **Data Transfer:** Forger users can transfer their data to ZBrush, but Forger’s native file format isn’t directly supported.

### Potential Challenges with ZBrush

One potential issue for Forger users with older iPads is that ZBrush is generally recommended for models with Apple's M-series silicon chips. Older iPads may experience performance issues. It's crucial to check the [ZBrush system requirements](https://www.maxon.net/en/requirements/zbrush-requirements?srsltid=AfmBOooCH8fAz6k5FGwt2Fe1iEeIZ5G1vsE0KXIKGn0KNL7zzP89FFuK) before committing to the switch.

### Alternative Sculpting Apps: Nomad Sculpt

If ZBrush isn't the right fit, especially for new or hobbyist iPad sculptors, **Nomad Sculpt** is a great alternative. It provides a beginner-friendly range of tools for a one-time $20 download fee. Nomad Sculpt is a powerful and affordable option for sculpting on the go.

### Key Takeaway: What Should Forger Users Do?

1.  **Evaluate ZBrush:** If you're a serious sculptor, explore ZBrush for iPad and see if its features and capabilities justify the higher cost. Consider the system requirements and whether your iPad can handle it.
2.  **Consider Nomad Sculpt:** If you're on a budget or just starting, Nomad Sculpt is an excellent alternative with a one-time purchase price.
3.  **Continue Using Forger (for now):** You can continue using Forger as long as it meets your needs, but be aware that it will no longer receive updates or support.
4.  **Back Up Your Work:** Regardless of your choice, always back up your Forger projects to ensure you don't lose your valuable creations.

### Actionable Tip

Before September 10th, download a trial version of ZBrush for iPad and experiment with it to see if it meets your sculpting needs. This hands-on experience will help you make an informed decision about whether to switch or explore other alternatives.

### FAQ

**Q: Can I still use Forger after September 10th?**

A: Yes, you can continue using Forger, but it will no longer receive updates or support.

**Q: Will my Forger subscription be automatically canceled?**

A: No, your Forger subscription will remain active until the end of your subscription term if you renew before September 10th.

**Q: Is ZBrush a direct replacement for Forger?**

A: ZBrush offers more features and capabilities than Forger, but it also has a higher learning curve and cost.

**Q: What are the system requirements for ZBrush on iPad?**

A: ZBrush is generally recommended for iPads with Apple's M-series silicon chips. Check the official Maxon website for detailed system requirements.

### Summary

While it may be disappointing for some users, it also presents an opportunity to explore more advanced tools like ZBrush or affordable alternatives like Nomad Sculpt. By carefully evaluating your needs and exploring your options, you can ensure a smooth transition and continue creating amazing digital sculptures.
