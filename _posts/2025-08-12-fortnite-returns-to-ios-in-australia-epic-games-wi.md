# Fortnite Returns to iOS in Australia: Epic Games Wins Antitrust Ruling

Great news for Fortnite fans in Australia! After a long battle, Epic Games is bringing Fortnite back to iOS devices in Australia. This comes after a ruling by the Australian Federal Court that Apple and Google's app marketplace practices were anticompetitive. Let's dive into the details.

## What Happened?

The Australian Federal Court found that Apple and Google abused their dominance in the app marketplace. The court stated that the high commission fees (up to 30%) charged by these companies reduced competition. This ruling has paved the way for Epic Games to launch its own Epic Games Store on iOS in Australia, bringing Fortnite back to iPhone users.

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney announced on X (formerly Twitter) that Fortnite would be available through the Epic Games Store on iOS, although the exact date is still to be determined. This is a significant win for Epic, who have been fighting against Apple and Google's app store policies for years.

## Epic's Legal Battles: A Quick Recap

Epic Games has been challenging Apple and Google's app store policies globally. Here's a quick rundown:

*   **Australia:** Epic sued Google in March 2021 and Apple in November 2020. Both cases were handled in parallel by the same court.
*   **United States:** Epic sued Apple and Google in August 2020. The outcomes were quite different.
    *   **Apple Case:** Epic largely lost the battle, even after appealing to the US Supreme Court. However, Apple may still face changes to its App Store practices due to non-compliance with a district court order.
    *   **Google Case:** Epic won! A jury decided that Google created an illegal monopoly with its Play Store and Play Billing system. This decision was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

## The Core Issue: App Store Dominance

The heart of the matter is the control that Apple and Google have over their respective app stores. Epic Games argues that these companies use their dominance to stifle competition and impose unfair fees on developers. The Australian court seems to agree, at least in part.

### What the Companies are Saying

Both Apple and Google have responded to the Australian court's ruling:

*   **Google:** A spokesperson stated that they welcomed the rejection of Epic's demands to distribute app stores within the Google Play Store. However, they disagreed with the court's characterization of their billing policies and practices.
*   **Apple:** An unnamed spokesperson said that Apple welcomed the rejection of some of Epic's claims but disagreed with other aspects of the ruling. They maintain that Apple faces fierce competition and continuously invests in making the App Store safe and beneficial for developers.

## Fortnite's Journey Back to iOS

Fortnite's return to iOS has been a bumpy ride. After being removed from the App Store in 2020 due to a dispute over in-app payments, the game has made its way back in different regions through various channels.

*   **EU:** Fortnite returned to iPhones in the EU last year via the Epic Games Store for iOS.
*   **Australia:** Now, Australian players can look forward to playing Fortnite on their iPhones through the Epic Games Store.

## Why This Matters

This ruling is significant for several reasons:

*   **Competition:** It could lead to increased competition in the app marketplace, potentially benefiting both developers and consumers.
*   **Developer Freedom:** It gives developers more freedom to choose how they distribute their apps and manage in-app payments.
*   **Global Impact:** The outcome of these legal battles could influence app store policies worldwide.

## Actionable Takeaway

If you're a developer, now is the time to explore alternative app distribution methods. The changing landscape of app stores could open up new opportunities for reaching your audience and maximizing your revenue. Consider building a web-based version of your app or exploring options like the Epic Games Store.

## The Future of App Stores

The legal battles between Epic Games, Apple, and Google are far from over. However, these cases are forcing a conversation about the fairness and openness of app stores. We can expect to see continued scrutiny of app store policies and potentially more regulatory intervention in the future.

### Expert Commentary (Simulated)

"This ruling in Australia is a major step forward for developer rights," says Dr. Anya Sharma, a tech policy expert. "It shows that courts are willing to challenge the dominance of Apple and Google and create a more level playing field for developers."
