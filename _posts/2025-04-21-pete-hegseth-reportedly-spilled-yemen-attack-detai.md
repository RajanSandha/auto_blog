## Second Signal Breach? Pete Hegseth Accused of Sharing Yemen Strike Details in Private Chat

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is once again facing intense scrutiny for allegedly disclosing sensitive military information—this time, about the March 15th airstrikes in Yemen—through a private Signal chat. This marks the second reported instance of such a breach, raising fresh concerns over communication protocols at the highest levels.

### A Recurring Pattern?

According to *The New York Times*, Hegseth used the encrypted messaging app Signal to share strike details with individuals outside official government channels, including his wife and about a dozen others from his personal and professional network. Four anonymous sources familiar with the matter confirmed the chat’s existence and content.

This revelation follows an earlier incident in which Hegseth accidentally included *The Atlantic* editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a similar Signal chat. Unlike that accidental inclusion, this “Defense | Team Huddle” group was intentionally created by Hegseth in January—before his confirmation as Secretary of Defense—and accessed via his personal phone rather than a government‐issued device.

### Sensitive Information Allegedly Shared

The information reportedly shared included “flight schedules for the F/A‑18 Hornets targeting the Houthis in Yemen.” While experts note the data was unclassified, even such operational details can pose significant national‐security risks if aggregated or pieced together by adversaries.

### Official Response and Staff Warnings

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the chat but insisted no classified material was exchanged. Nonetheless, aides warn that Hegseth was cautioned days before the March 15 strikes to avoid discussing such topics on Signal and to migrate any official communications to his secure government device—warnings he allegedly ignored.

### Implications for Security and Trust

- **Operational Security:** Could unclassified details be combined with open‐source intelligence to compromise missions?  
- **Protocol Adherence:** Did Hegseth violate Defense Department guidelines by using a personal device for sensitive discussions?  
- **Judgment & Leadership:** Does this pattern indicate a broader lapse in security awareness at the top of the department?

### What’s Next?

No formal investigation has been announced yet, but internal reviews appear likely. Depending on outcomes, Hegseth could face anything from a formal reprimand to calls for his resignation. This episode underscores the urgent need for robust cybersecurity training, strict enforcement of communication protocols, and accountability at all levels of government.
