## What is NYT Connections: Sports Edition?

*Connections: Sports Edition*, in collaboration with *The Athletic*, is a word association game where you're presented with 16 words and must group them into four categories of four. It's available on both web browsers and mobile devices, making it easy to get your daily dose of puzzling.

Think of it as a sports-themed version of the original *Connections* game. The categories can range from types of equipment to famous athletes, so a broad knowledge of sports is definitely an asset.

## How to Play Connections: Sports Edition

The rules are simple, but mastering the game takes strategy:

*   **Pay Attention to Color Coding:** The colors provide valuable clues about the difficulty of each category.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Shuffle:** A fresh arrangement of the words can sometimes reveal hidden connections.
