## macOS 26: Spotlight Gets a Major Upgrade and a Fresh Look

Apple's macOS has often played second fiddle to iOS and iPadOS, but it looks like Apple is giving its desktop operating system some much-needed attention with the upcoming macOS 26. The developer beta is out, and it's packed with improvements, most notably a revamped Spotlight search and a slick new "Liquid Glass" user interface.

If you're a Mac user, this is an update to get excited about. Let's dive into what macOS 26 has to offer.

## Spotlight: More Than Just a Search Bar

Spotlight is getting a serious upgrade in macOS 26. It's evolving from a simple search tool to a powerful command center. Here's what's new:

*   **File Finder Extraordinaire:** Spotlight can now find specific files, even those buried deep within folders or cloud services.
*   **Web Search Wizard:** It can search cloud file services and websites directly, saving you the trouble of opening a browser.
*   **Automation Powerhouse:** Run Apple Shortcuts and automations right from Spotlight.
*   **Command Line Lite:** Execute basic commands, like quickly finding your recent screenshots by typing "/screenshot."

Think of it as a super-powered command line interface, accessible with a simple keystroke (Command + Space). This enhanced **Spotlight** feature is a game-changer for Mac power users, offering a level of efficiency that Windows users can only dream of.

### Actionable Tip: Customize Your Spotlight Search

Dive into Spotlight settings and customize which categories are included in your searches. This can help you narrow down results and find what you're looking for even faster.

## Liquid Glass: A Fresh Coat of Paint

macOS 26 introduces a new visual style called "Liquid Glass." This design language emphasizes transparency and visual flourishes throughout the operating system.

*   **Transparent Menu Bar:** The menu bar at the top of the screen is now fully transparent, creating a more modern and spacious feel.
*   **Refreshed Widgets and Control Center:** Widgets and the Control Center dropdown have a more glass-like appearance.

While these changes are primarily cosmetic, they contribute to a more polished and refined user experience. According to early beta testers, the visual upgrades don't seem to impact performance, even on older Macs.

## Enhanced iPhone Integration

Apple is continuing to tighten the integration between macOS and iOS with macOS 26.

*   **Dedicated Phone App:** A new Phone app provides a convenient way to access contacts and recent calls on your Mac.
*   **iPhone Live Activities on Your Desktop:** Keep track of Uber rides, food deliveries, and other live activities directly from the macOS menu bar.
*   **Seamless App Launching:** If you need to interact with a specific activity, macOS can automatically launch the corresponding app on your iPhone via iPhone mirroring.

These features make it easier than ever to stay connected and productive, regardless of which device you're using.

## Other Notable Upgrades in macOS 26

Beyond Spotlight, Liquid Glass, and iPhone integration, macOS 26 includes a number of other smaller but still significant improvements:

*   **Shortcuts App Enhancements:** The Shortcuts app is becoming more powerful with new custom automations and Apple Intelligence-powered actions. You can now integrate on-device AI models and ChatGPT into your workflows.
*   **Safari Refresh:** Safari gets a Liquid Glass redesign for a more polished look.
*   **Smarter Notes App:** The Notes app now offers Apple Intelligence-powered reminders when you share content to it, helping you stay on top of important tasks.
