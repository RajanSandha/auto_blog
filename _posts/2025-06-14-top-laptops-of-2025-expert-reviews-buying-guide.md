When choosing a **Windows laptop** or any other kind, focusing on the right specs is essential. Here's a breakdown of what to keep in mind:

### RAM: 16 GB as the New Standard

Aim for at least 16 GB of RAM. This is becoming the standard, even in more affordable laptops. Upgrading to 32 GB is even better, ensuring you never run out of memory, especially if you're a gamer or video editor.

### CPU: Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm?

For Windows laptops, you have three primary CPU brands: Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm.

The ideal display depends on the laptop's size. A 1200-pixel resolution (HD+) screen is sufficient for a 13- or 14-inch laptop, but larger displays require more pixels. While IPS screens are suitable for most users, OLED or Mini-LED screens offer better color accuracy, contrast, and HDR performance.

### Connectivity: Ports and Wi-Fi

Ports are crucial, though needs vary. Aim for at least two USB-C ports and one USB-A and HDMI for legacy devices. Remember that most laptops use a USB-C port for the power adapter. Thankfully, most laptops still have headphone jacks. Ensure Wi-Fi 6E support or newer for future-proofing. You might also want to check the  and  guides.
