## Thy, the AI Radio Host: Months of Unnoticed Airwaves in Australia

The line between human and artificial intelligence continues to blur, and the latest example comes from the world of radio. In a story that raises questions about transparency and the future of media, an Australian radio station, CADA, has been using an AI-generated DJ named Thy to host a four-hour segment for months – and apparently, nobody noticed.

### The Rise of AI in Radio

The revelation, initially reported by *The Carpet* newsletter and the *Australian Financial Review*, highlights the increasing sophistication of AI and its potential to infiltrate various industries. CADA's show, *Workdays with Thy*, features a mix of hip-hop, R&B, and pop music. What makes this unique is that the host, Thy, is entirely AI-generated. There was no disclosure to listeners that they were not listening to a human host.

### How Thy Was Created

ARN Media, the owner of CADA, confirmed that Thy is indeed an AI creation. Interestingly, Thy's voice and likeness are modeled after a real employee from the company's financial department. The AI voice itself was reportedly generated using ElevenLabs, a popular AI voice generator known for its realistic and expressive voices.

### Lack of Transparency Sparks Controversy

A key point of contention is the absence of disclosure regarding Thy's AI nature. Neither CADA's website nor the radio show itself informs listeners that the host is not a real person. The show's description on CADA's website reads: "Curated by our music experts, these are the songs that are charting or on the cusp of blowing up — hear it first with Thy so you can boast to your friends and say you were all over it first." This description gives no hint that the host is AI-generated, potentially misleading listeners.

### Industry Reactions and Ethical Concerns

The lack of transparency has drawn criticism from industry professionals. Teresa Lim, the vice president of the Australian Association of Voice Actors, voiced her concerns on LinkedIn, stating that "Australian listeners deserve honesty and upfront disclosure instead of a lack of transparency leading them to trust a fake person they think is a real on-air person." Her comment underscores the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in media and the importance of informing audiences when they are interacting with AI-generated content.

### ARN Media's Perspective

ARN CEO Ciaran Davis acknowledged the blurring lines between reality and AI, telling the *Financial Review*, "We're trying to understand what's real and what's not. What we've learned is the power of the announcers we have." This statement suggests that ARN Media is still grappling with the implications of AI in radio and the value of human announcers.

### A Growing Trend: AI in Broadcasting

CADA is not alone in exploring the use of AI in radio. Other stations, including one in Portland, Oregon, and Sirius XM, have also experimented with AI-generated content. Last year, a Polish radio station even replaced journalists with AI hosts, although the experiment was later discontinued following public backlash. These instances highlight a growing trend of incorporating AI into broadcasting, driven by factors such as cost savings and efficiency.

### The Broader Implications of AI in Media

The use of AI-generated radio hosts raises several broader questions about the future of media:

*   **Authenticity and Trust:** How does the use of AI impact the authenticity and trustworthiness of media content? When audiences are unaware that they are interacting with AI, it can erode trust in the media outlet.
*   **Job Displacement:** The increasing use of AI in media raises concerns about job displacement for human workers, such as radio hosts, journalists, and voice actors.
*   **Copyright and Intellectual Property:** The creation of AI-generated content also raises complex questions about copyright and intellectual property. Who owns the rights to AI-generated voices and content?
*   **Regulation and Ethics:** Should there be regulations governing the use of AI in media to ensure transparency and ethical practices?

### The Future of Radio: A Hybrid Approach?

While the use of AI in radio presents challenges, it also offers potential benefits. AI can automate tasks, personalize content, and create new forms of entertainment. One possible future scenario is a hybrid approach, where AI assists human broadcasters and enhances the listening experience, rather than replacing human talent entirely.

### The Need for Open Dialogue

The case of Thy, the AI radio host, underscores the need for an open and honest dialogue about the role of AI in media. It is crucial for media organizations, industry professionals, and policymakers to work together to develop ethical guidelines and best practices for the use of AI. Transparency and disclosure should be paramount to maintain audience trust and ensure a sustainable future for the media industry. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential to navigate its potential benefits and risks responsibly.

### Conclusion

The story of Thy serves as a wake-up call, highlighting the rapid advancements in AI and its potential to disrupt traditional industries. While AI offers exciting possibilities for innovation in radio and other forms of media, it is crucial to proceed with caution and prioritize transparency, ethical considerations, and the value of human creativity. The future of radio may very well involve AI, but it's a future that needs to be shaped by thoughtful discussion and responsible implementation.
