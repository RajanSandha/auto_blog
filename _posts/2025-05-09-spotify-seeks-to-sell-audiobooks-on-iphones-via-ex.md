## Spotify Seeks to Sell Audiobooks on iPhones via External Links: A Win for Consumers?

Spotify is making a significant move that could change how iPhone users purchase audiobooks. The streaming giant has submitted an update to Apple that, if approved, will allow users in the US to buy audiobooks directly through external links within the Spotify app. This development follows a landmark court ruling in the *Epic Games v. Apple* case and promises to bring greater flexibility and potentially lower prices to consumers.

### The Update: What to Expect

According to Spotify's recent announcement, the proposed update includes the ability for users to purchase audiobooks via external links. This means that instead of being forced to use Apple's in-app purchase system, which often involves a significant commission, users could be directed to Spotify's own website or another platform to complete their purchase. Additionally, the update aims to allow Premium users to buy "top-ups" for additional audiobook listening time, providing more granular control over their audiobook consumption.

### The Legal Battleground: Epic Games v. Apple

The driving force behind this change is the ongoing legal saga between Epic Games and Apple. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Apple was in "willful violation" of a 2021 injunction by taking up to a 27 percent commission on purchases made through external links. The court order also prevents Apple from restricting developers from directing users to alternative purchase options outside the App Store.

This ruling has opened the door for developers like Spotify to explore new ways to offer their services and products to iOS users, bypassing Apple's commission structure. It's a move that could have far-reaching implications for the App Store ecosystem and the relationship between Apple and developers.

### Spotify's History with Audiobooks on iOS

Spotify's journey with audiobooks on iOS has been fraught with challenges. The company previously attempted to circumvent Apple's restrictions by avoiding displaying prices within the app and instead emailing users links to purchase audiobooks on the web. However, Spotify eventually removed audiobook purchases from its iOS app altogether, highlighting the difficulties of navigating Apple's App Store policies.

The new update represents a renewed effort to offer audiobooks to iOS users in a more direct and consumer-friendly way.

### Spotify's Perspective: Leveling the Playing Field

Spotify is framing this update as a step towards creating a fairer ecosystem for developers and consumers. In its announcement, the company stated that the update "helps level the playing field by allowing developers to offer basic pricing information and easy-to-access links to purchase digital goods through iPhones with no unnecessary steps or additional taxes levied by Apple." They argue that this freedom would benefit authors, audiences, and developers alike.

However, Spotify's optimism is tempered by the uncertainty surrounding Apple's response. The company acknowledges that the update's success hinges on Apple's approval and the legal ruling standing firm, despite Apple's ongoing attempts to challenge it.

### Apple's Resistance: An Ongoing Appeal

Apple has requested the court to halt the order while it appeals the decision in the *Epic Games v. Apple* case. This indicates that Apple is not willing to relinquish its control over the App Store ecosystem without a fight. The outcome of the appeal could have significant consequences for the future of app distribution and monetization on iOS.

Despite Apple's resistance, other apps are already taking advantage of the newly relaxed policies. Apps like Kindle, Patreon, and Delta's emulator are exploring ways to offer external purchase options to their users, signaling a potential shift in the App Store landscape.

### Implications for Consumers

If Spotify's update is approved and the legal ruling stands, consumers could benefit in several ways:

*   **Lower Prices:** Bypassing Apple's commission could allow Spotify to offer audiobooks at lower prices.
*   **More Choice:** Users would have more flexibility in how they purchase audiobooks, potentially accessing different payment methods or loyalty programs.
*   **Direct Relationship with Spotify:** Purchasing directly from Spotify could strengthen the relationship between the company and its users, potentially leading to personalized recommendations and exclusive offers.

### The Future of App Store Policies

Spotify's attempt to sell audiobooks via external links on iPhones is a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate over App Store policies. The outcome of this situation could set a precedent for other developers looking to bypass Apple's commission structure. It also highlights the growing tension between Apple's control over its platform and the desire of developers for greater freedom and flexibility.

Whether Apple approves Spotify's update remains to be seen. However, the mere fact that Spotify is pushing for this change underscores the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo and the potential for significant disruption in the App Store ecosystem.

### Conclusion

Spotify's move to offer audiobook purchases via external links represents a potential win for consumers and a challenge to Apple's control over the App Store. As the legal battle between Epic Games and Apple continues to unfold, the future of app distribution and monetization on iOS remains uncertain. One thing is clear: the power dynamics between platform owners and developers are shifting, and consumers could ultimately benefit from a more open and competitive ecosystem. Keep an eye on this developing story as it will undoubtedly shape the digital landscape for years to come.
