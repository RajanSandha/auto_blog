# Google AI Mode: Get Ready for More Ads in Your AI Search

Google is about to change the way we experience AI search. Get ready to see more advertisements integrated into Google's AI Mode, aiming to boost ad revenue. This move builds on Google's existing advertising model, bringing it into the realm of AI-powered search.

## What's Happening?

According to a report from AdAge, Google is actively pitching AI Mode ads to advertisers. A key message from Google to potential buyers is to "Be part of our most powerful AI search experience, as customers explore their biggest questions with AI Mode."

This suggests that Google sees AI Mode as a prime opportunity for businesses to connect with users seeking information. Google has told advertisers that the new ads would come in the form of text and shopping ads with product details within AI Mode chats, presented in response to user queries. These ads will be clearly marked as "Sponsored."

## How Will These Ads Look?

Based on mock-ups, these AI Mode advertisements will appear in banners under AI search queries. They will be easily identifiable by a "Sponsored" label, ensuring users understand they are viewing paid content.

Google describes this as an "experiment," but early signs point to a significant shift in how ads are delivered within the search experience.

## When Can We Expect These Changes?

Reportedly, Google plans to roll out these ads in AI mode before the fourth quarter of this year. In fact, they've already started showing more ads in AI mode and have seen "incredible results." This aligns with their announcement in May 2025, where they stated, "Where relevant, ads may appear below and integrated into AI Mode responses."

## Why Is Google Doing This?

Google's revenue from ads was estimated to be a staggering $96.5 billion in the fourth quarter of last year alone. As Google transitions from traditional search to AI search, it makes sense that their massive ad inventory would follow suit. While advertisements have been relatively rare in AI chatbots like Google Gemini and ChatGPT, this is set to change.

Google holds a significant lead in the AI search arena, boasting 30 times more traffic than its rivals. Their AI search results have already surpassed those of competitors like ChatGPT, with 16.5 billion visits in December 2024.

## The Future of AI Search Advertising

Google's move to incorporate ads into its AI search tools is just the beginning. Spending on AI-powered search advertising is projected to reach nearly $29 billion by 2029, according to Reuters. This indicates a major shift in the digital advertising landscape.

### The Impact on Users

*   **More Relevant Results:** The goal is to provide ads that are relevant to user queries, enhancing the overall search experience.
*   **Transparency:** Ads will be clearly labeled as "Sponsored" to avoid confusion.
*   **Potential for Disruption:** The increased presence of ads could potentially disrupt the user experience if not implemented carefully.

### The Impact on Businesses

*   **New Opportunities:** Businesses will have new avenues to reach potential customers through AI-powered search.
*   **Increased Competition:** The AI search ad space is likely to become increasingly competitive.
*   **Need for Adaptation:** Businesses will need to adapt their advertising strategies to effectively target users in the AI search environment.
