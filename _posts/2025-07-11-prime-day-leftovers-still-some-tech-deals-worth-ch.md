This is a great opportunity to snag deals on laptops, tablets, and other gadgets that might have been overlooked during the initial rush. Keep an eye out for discounts on open-box items, refurbished products, or bundle deals that offer extra value.

Chromebooks have come a long way. They're no longer just for basic tasks. The **Acer Chromebook Plus 515**, for example, offers a 1080p display, a spacious screen, and an Intel Core i3 processor. It's a solid machine for everyday use, especially if you're on a budget. Luke Larsen from WIRED notes that this Chromebook is a strong machine if your needs aren't high.

#### Microsoft Surface: Versatility at a Discount

The **Microsoft Surface Pro 11th Edition** is a 2-in-1 laptop that's finally living up to its potential. It offers great performance, battery life, and design. If you're looking for a true iPad Pro alternative for Windows users, this could be it. The latest Surface Pro keyboard even allows you to work while disconnected from the device, making it a great travel companion.

#### Android Tablets: A Samsung Standout

If you're in the market for a flagship Android tablet, the **Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 series** is worth considering. It features an 11-inch AMOLED screen, excellent performance, and includes a stylus. Julian Chokkattu from WIRED says it's the smallest of the lot, making it the easiest to use and stating that it comes very close to being an iPad.
