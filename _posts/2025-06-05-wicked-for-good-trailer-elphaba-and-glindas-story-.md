## What to Expect in 'Wicked: For Good'

Directed once again by Jon M. Chu, *Wicked: For Good* dives deeper into the complexities of Elphaba and Glinda's relationship. After the events of the first film, Elphaba is now in hiding, branded as the Wicked Witch of the West.

Meanwhile, Glinda has risen to prominence, becoming a beloved figure and a symbol of goodness. She's even engaged to Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey)!

As she basks in the adoration of the people of Oz, she grapples with the moral implications of her choices. Will she remain true to herself, or will she succumb to the pressures of fame and power?

### A Kansas Girl in Oz
