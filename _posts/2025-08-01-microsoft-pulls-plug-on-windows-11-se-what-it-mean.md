Microsoft is ending support for Windows 11 SE, its Chrome OS competitor, next year. Launched five years ago on low-cost laptops targeting the education sector, Windows 11 SE aimed to dissuade schools from adopting Google Chromebooks. But what went wrong, and what does this mean for the future of budget-friendly computing in education?

## The End of the Line for Windows 11 SE

Microsoft officially announced that support for Windows 11 SE, encompassing software updates, technical assistance, and crucial security fixes, will cease in October 2026. While devices running the OS will continue to function, Microsoft strongly advises users to transition to a device compatible with another edition of Windows 11 to maintain ongoing support and security.

According to an updated support article, the upcoming 25H2 update for Windows 11 will not be released for Windows 11 SE. This means these devices will remain on version 24H2 until the end-of-life date next year.

Many manufacturers, including Acer, Asus, Dell, Dynabook, Fujitsu, HP, JK-IP, Lenovo, and Positivo, produced Windows 11 SE laptops. Microsoft even launched its own Surface Laptop SE in 2021, priced at an affordable $249.

## Why Did Windows 11 SE Fail?

Microsoft's attempts to challenge Chrome OS have a history of setbacks. One previous approach, S Mode, restricted Windows 10 to apps from the Microsoft Store. This frustrated users due to the limited app selection.

Windows 11 SE adopted a similar strategy, encouraging schools to utilize Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) over traditional win32 applications. IT administrators had to manually enable exceptions for devices to run win32 apps, and Microsoft maintained a restricted list of allowed apps for the OS. This inflexibility likely contributed to its limited adoption.

## The Rise and Fall of Chromebooks

Interestingly, Microsoft's decision to discontinue Windows 11 SE coincides with a shift in the market. A year prior, Gartner cautioned that Chromebooks were losing market share due to their restricted customer base and perceived lower build quality. Chromebook shipments have been declining since 2022, and the current PC refresh cycle appears to be primarily driven by Windows 11 upgrades rather than migrations to Chrome OS.

## What Does This Mean for Education? 

The demise of Windows 11 SE leaves a gap in the market for affordable, education-focused laptops. Schools will need to consider alternative solutions for providing students with access to technology. This could involve:

*   Investing in standard Windows 11 laptops.
*   Exploring alternative operating systems like Linux.
*   Re-evaluating the role of Chromebooks in the classroom.

It's likely we'll see manufacturers focus on creating more affordable standard Windows 11 laptops to fill the void left by Windows 11 SE.

### The Future of Education Technology

While Windows 11 SE didn't succeed, its attempt highlights the ongoing need for affordable and manageable technology in education. Microsoft's next steps in this space will be interesting to watch. Will they focus on improving the manageability of standard Windows 11, or will they attempt another specialized operating system?

**Actionable Takeaway:** If your school or organization is currently using Windows 11 SE devices, start planning your migration to another operating system or newer hardware. October 2026 might seem far away, but transitioning a large number of devices can take time and resources. Begin evaluating your options now to ensure a smooth transition.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **What happens to my Windows 11 SE device after October 2026?**
    Your device will continue to function, but it will no longer receive software updates, security patches, or technical support. This makes it increasingly vulnerable to security threats.
*   **Can I upgrade Windows 11 SE to a different version of Windows?**
    It depends on the device's hardware capabilities. Some devices may be able to be upgraded, while others may not meet the minimum requirements for other Windows 11 editions.
*   **What are the alternatives to Windows 11 SE?**
    Consider standard Windows 11 laptops, Chromebooks (despite their recent decline), or Linux-based operating systems.

## Key Takeaways

*   Microsoft is ending support for Windows 11 SE in October 2026.
*   Windows 11 SE was designed as a Chrome OS competitor for the education market.
*   The OS restricted app usage, which likely hindered its adoption.
*   Schools using Windows 11 SE need to plan their migration to a new OS or hardware.
*   The future of education technology will likely involve more affordable standard Windows 11 laptops.
