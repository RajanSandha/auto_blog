## What is Hurdle?

Hurdle is a word game with five rounds. In each round, you need to guess a five-letter word. The game provides feedback on your guesses, indicating:

*   **Correct letters:** These are highlighted in green.
*   **Misplaced letters:** These are highlighted in yellow, meaning the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
*   **Incorrect letters:** These are not highlighted.

The twist? If you guess the word correctly, the next hurdle starts with the previous answer as your first guess! This can offer helpful clues, or sometimes, throw you off completely.

## Strategies to Improve Your Hurdle Game

While knowing the answers can get you through today's game, developing a good strategy will help you conquer future Hurdles. Here are a few tips:

*   **Start with common letters:** Use words containing common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) in your initial guesses. This helps you quickly identify potential letters.
*   **Eliminate letters:** Pay close attention to the letters that are *not* highlighted. Avoid using them in subsequent guesses.
*   **Consider letter frequency:** Some letters are more common than others. Think about the typical frequency of letters in the English language when making guesses.
*   **Look for patterns:** As you progress through the hurdles, pay attention to any patterns or relationships between the words. The previous answer provides a valuable clue.
*   **Don't repeat misplaced letters:** If a letter is highlighted in yellow, don't use it in the same position in your next guess.

"This mental exercise can help maintain cognitive function as we age."
