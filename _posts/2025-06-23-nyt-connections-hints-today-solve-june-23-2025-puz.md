*Connections* is all about finding the common threads between words. Think of it as a word association game on steroids.

Want to solve it yourself? Keep reading for clues and strategies! Just want the answer? Scroll to the bottom.

## What Makes Connections So Addictive?

The *NYT's* *Connections* game has quickly become a social media sensation. The game, which challenges players to group four words that share a common link, was brought to the *Times*' Games section with the help of associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu. You can play **Connections** on your web browser or mobile device.

Each puzzle presents you with 16 words, and your mission is to group them into four categories. These categories can be anything â€“ from types of software to names of countries. The catch? Some words might seem to fit into multiple categories, but there's only one right answer.

If you nail all four words in a set, they vanish from the board. But beware! Incorrect guesses count as mistakes, and you only get four before the game ends. 

Players can also shuffle the board to help them spot the **connections**. The categories are color-coded, with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. And just like *Wordle*, you can brag (or commiserate) with your friends by sharing your results on social media.

## Need a Little Nudge? Here Are Some Hints

Stuck on today's puzzle? Here are some broader hints to get you thinking:

*   Yellow: Think about what you might wear.
*   Green: Consider different types of stories.
