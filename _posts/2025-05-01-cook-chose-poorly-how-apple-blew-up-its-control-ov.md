# Apple's App Store Under Fire: Judge Accuses Tech Giant of Deliberate Non-Compliance

Apple's iron grip on the App Store has been a subject of intense scrutiny for years, culminating in a landmark legal battle with Epic Games in 2021. While Apple largely emerged victorious in that initial case, a key outcome was a court order demanding that the company **loosen its control** and allow developers to inform users about alternative payment methods outside the App Store.

Now, nearly four years later, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has delivered a scathing assessment: **Apple deliberately failed to comply** with the spirit of that order and actively attempted to conceal its non-compliance.

## The Anti-Steering Injunction: A Loophole Exploited?

The heart of the matter lies in the *anti-steering injunction* issued after the Epic Games trial. It mandated Apple to permit developers to include **buttons and links** within their apps directing users to alternative payment options.

Although intended to promote competition, vague language in the order created a loophole—one Apple allegedly **exploited**.

## 'Cook Chose Poorly': A Deliberate Strategy of Anti-Competitive Behavior

According to Judge Gonzalez Rogers, Apple didn't simply misinterpret the court's order — the company actively **strategized to circumvent** it.

The judge made it clear: Apple **deliberately chose the least competitive path** while pretending to comply. As a result, she rejected the idea of giving Apple a second chance and is now demanding **specific changes** to the App Store to enforce the original ruling.

## What Were Apple's Alleged Tactics?

While the full scope is still emerging, some of Apple’s tactics may include:

- **Onerous Requirements:** Complex guidelines making it hard for developers to use external links.
- **Excessive Fees:** Charging high commissions even on external transactions.
- **Limited Visibility:** Making alternative options hard to find within apps.

These would effectively **discourage developers and consumers** from straying from Apple’s in-app payment system.

## The Implications for Developers

This ruling could significantly shift the landscape for developers:

- **Increased Revenue:** No more 15–30% cut to Apple could mean more income.
- **Control and Flexibility:** Developers could manage pricing and customer interactions directly.
- **Boost in Competition:** Encouraging innovation from smaller and independent developers.

The benefits, however, depend on how far-reaching the **court-mandated changes** will be.

## The Impact on Consumers

Consumers could benefit through:

- **Lower Prices:** As developers pass savings on.
- **More Payment Options:** Greater flexibility at checkout.
- **App Diversity:** A more open store could mean better apps and services.

## What's Next for Apple?

Apple is expected to appeal the decision, so the legal saga is far from over. But the court's firm stance sends a clear message: **anti-competitive practices will be challenged**.

In the meantime, Apple must begin implementing changes—likely involving better support for external payments, reduced fees, and improved visibility.

## Conclusion: A Turning Point for the App Store?

Judge Gonzalez Rogers’ ruling represents a **critical challenge to Apple’s dominance** over the App Store.

While legal battles will continue, this moment could mark the **beginning of a more open and competitive mobile ecosystem**, with real benefits for developers and consumers alike.
