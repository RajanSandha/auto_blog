# Nintendo's Alarmo: A Step Towards Fixing Joy-Con Drift with Innovative Tech

Nintendo has long been recognized as a giant in the gaming industry, but it hasn't been without its controversies. One of the most persistent issues has been the notorious Joy-Con drift, a problem that plagues many Nintendo Switch users. Despite the ongoing complaints, Nintendo continues to ship the Switch with the same hardware that can lead to joystick drift and false inputs over time. However, recent revelations from iFixit's teardown of the Nintendo Alarmo alarm clock suggest that the company may be pivoting towards more reliable technology in at least one of its devices.

## A Closer Look at Alarmo

The Nintendo Alarmo is not just any alarm clock; it’s a product that showcases innovative technology and design. During the teardown, iFixit discovered a simple yet effective construction process. With just a single tri-point screw on the bottom of the clock, users can easily remove the faceplate, allowing for straightforward access to the internal components.

### Internal Components

Inside the Alarmo, the components are relatively standard for a modern alarm clock but with some noteworthy features that set it apart. Below the 2.4-inch LCD screen, there lies a 24GHz mmWave presence sensor designed to detect body movements. This feature is particularly useful for determining whether a user is still asleep when the alarm goes off. Additionally, the clock houses a replaceable CR2032 coin cell backup battery. This battery ensures that settings are preserved even when the clock is unplugged.

## The Game-Changing Hall Effect Sensor

Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the Alarmo's design is the inclusion of a magnet and Hall effect sensor within the rotary dial button. This technology, which has already been adopted by various third-party controllers, is expected to significantly improve the accuracy of the dial's functionality. Unlike the Joy-Con sticks, which are prone to drift due to their underlying technology, the Hall effect sensor provides a more reliable solution.

### Implications for Joy-Con Drift

The presence of this advanced technology in the Alarmo raises questions about Nintendo's approach to the Joy-Con drift issue. It seems incongruous that the company would choose to implement such reliable technology in a non-gaming device while continuing to use potentially problematic hardware in its flagship gaming controllers. With the upcoming release of the next-generation Switch rumored for April 2nd, many fans are hoping that Nintendo will take a cue from the Alarmo and incorporate similar advancements into its gaming hardware.

## The Future of Nintendo's Hardware

As we await further developments from Nintendo, the potential for improved hardware is exciting. The Alarmo serves as a reminder that the company is capable of integrating modern technology to enhance user experience, even in simple devices like an alarm clock. If Nintendo can successfully transfer this innovation to its gaming controllers, it could lead to a more satisfying experience for gamers and potentially resolve the longstanding Joy-Con drift issue.

### Conclusion

Nintendo's Alarmo alarm clock is more than just a timekeeping device; it represents a step towards better technology that may one day benefit gaming hardware as well. With its innovative use of Hall effect sensors and a straightforward design, Alarmo shows that Nintendo is capable of evolving its technology. As we approach the anticipated announcement of the next Switch console, fans are left wondering if these improvements will finally address the Joy-Con drift problem that has frustrated so many players. Only time will tell if Nintendo can bring these advancements to its gaming lineup and restore the faith of its loyal fans.
