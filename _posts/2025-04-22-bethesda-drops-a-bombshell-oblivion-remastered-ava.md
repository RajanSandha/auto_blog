### A Defining Moment Reborn

"*Oblivion* was a real defining moment in the series and for how we make games as a studio," says Todd Howard, studio head of Bethesda.

### More Than Just a Remaster: A Ground-Up Rebuild

While the name implies a simple remaster, Virtuous has gone above and beyond. *Oblivion Remastered* is actually a complete remake of the original game, built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. This isn't just a texture upgrade; it's a fundamental reimagining of the game's visuals.

Virtuous has showcased several comparisons between the 2006 release and *Oblivion Remastered*, and the differences are truly striking. Every single asset, from character models to environmental details, has been remade from scratch. The result is a world that feels both familiar and incredibly fresh, with dramatically improved lighting, shadows, and overall visual fidelity.

### Unreal Engine 5 Enhancements: Lip Sync and More

The power of Unreal Engine 5 extends beyond just graphical enhancements. *Oblivion Remastered* also benefits from significant improvements to lip-syncing, bringing a new level of realism to character interactions. This is a welcome upgrade that addresses one of the original game's more dated aspects.

### From Rumors to Reality: The Road to Remastered

The existence of an *Oblivion* remaster was first hinted at in 2023, thanks to leaked documents from the FTC's case against Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. These documents also suggested potential remasters of *Fallout 3* and a new installment in the *Dishonored* franchise, further fueling excitement among fans of Bethesda's iconic titles. While those other projects remain unconfirmed, the release of *Oblivion Remastered* is a tangible sign that Bethesda is committed to revisiting and revitalizing its classic games.
