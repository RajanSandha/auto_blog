# Meta Snags OpenAI Star: Shengjia Zhao to Lead AI Superintelligence Lab

Meta is doubling down on its AI ambitions, and they're bringing in some serious firepower to do it. The company recently announced that Shengjia Zhao, a former key researcher at OpenAI, will be the Chief Scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). This move signals Meta's commitment to competing head-to-head with the likes of OpenAI and Google in the race for AI dominance.

## Who is Shengjia Zhao?

Shengjia Zhao isn't just any AI researcher. He's a major contributor to some of OpenAI's most impressive achievements, including:

*   ChatGPT
*   GPT-4
*   OpenAI's first AI reasoning model, o1

Landing Zhao is a significant win for Meta, showing they're serious about attracting top AI talent. Mark Zuckerberg himself announced the appointment on Threads, highlighting Zhao's role in co-founding the new lab and leading its scientific direction from the start.

## Meta's AI Dream Team: Assembling the Avengers

Zhao will be working under Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of Scale AI, who was recently appointed to lead MSL. While Wang's background isn't in research, the addition of Zhao provides the necessary scientific expertise to guide the lab's direction. Meta is clearly building a complementary leadership structure.

Beyond Zhao and Wang, Meta has been on a recruiting spree, poaching researchers from top AI labs like:

*   OpenAI
*   Google DeepMind
*   Safe Superintelligence
*   Apple
*   Anthropic

They're also drawing talent from within Meta's existing AI teams, including Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) and the GenAI unit. This influx of talent suggests Meta is creating a dedicated and highly skilled team focused solely on advancing AI superintelligence.

## The Focus: AI Reasoning and Beyond

Zuckerberg emphasized Zhao's pioneering work, specifically mentioning a "new scaling paradigm." This likely refers to Zhao's contributions to OpenAI's o1 reasoning model. Currently, Meta lacks a direct competitor to o1, making AI reasoning a key area of focus for MSL.

What exactly is AI reasoning? It's the ability of an AI to not just process information, but to understand and apply it in a logical way, much like a human. This is a crucial step towards creating truly intelligent AI systems.

## Investing in Infrastructure: Powering the AI Revolution

It's not just about talent; Meta is also investing heavily in the infrastructure needed to train these advanced AI models. By 2026, MSL researchers will have access to Meta's massive one-gigawatt cloud computing cluster, Prometheus, located in Ohio.

To put that into perspective, one gigawatt is enough power for over 750,000 homes! This will give Meta the computational power needed to conduct the massive training runs required to develop cutting-edge AI models, putting them in a strong position to compete with other leading AI labs.

## Meta's AI Strategy: A Multi-Pronged Approach

With the addition of Zhao, Meta now has two chief AI scientists: Zhao at MSL and Yann LeCun, who leads FAIR. FAIR focuses on long-term AI research, exploring techniques that might be used 5-10 years in the future. MSL, on the other hand, appears to be focused on more immediate, impactful advancements in AI superintelligence.

How these different AI units will collaborate remains to be seen, but it suggests a comprehensive AI strategy, covering both fundamental research and near-term product development. This approach could give Meta a significant advantage in the long run.

## The AI Talent Wars: Meta's Bold Move

Landing Shengjia Zhao is a clear sign that Meta is willing to go to great lengths to secure top AI talent. Reports suggest Zuckerberg has been personally involved in the recruiting process, even offering lucrative compensation packages to attract the best researchers. This aggressive approach highlights the intensity of the AI talent wars, as companies compete for the individuals who will shape the future of artificial intelligence.

**Actionable Takeaway:** If you're an aspiring AI researcher, now is the time to hone your skills! The demand for AI talent is incredibly high, and companies like Meta are actively seeking out individuals with the potential to make a real impact.
