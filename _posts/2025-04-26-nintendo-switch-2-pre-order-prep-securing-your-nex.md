## Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Order Prep: Securing Your Next-Gen Console

The Nintendo Switch 2 is on the horizon, and the hype is real. After a brief delay attributed to shifting tariff policies, the initial pre-order launch was, to put it mildly, chaotic. Retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, and GameStop faced overwhelming demand, leaving many gamers empty-handed. While pre-orders are currently paused, the anticipation continues to build. Don't worry, though! This guide will help you prepare for the next wave of pre-orders and increase your chances of snagging the coveted console.

Nintendo is still allowing sign-ups for those hoping to secure a Switch 2, but they've made it clear that securing an invite is not guaranteed due to overwhelming demand. The good news is that retailers are expected to open up for preorders again. Let's dive into how you can maximize your chances of securing a Nintendo Switch 2.

### Stay Vigilant: Retailer Landing Pages

One of the most crucial steps is to monitor the landing pages of major retailers. These pages will likely be the first to update with any news regarding pre-orders. Bookmark these pages and check them regularly:

*   **My Nintendo Store:** [Link to Nintendo Store](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/)
*   **Walmart:** [Link to Walmart's Gaming Section](https://www.walmart.com/browse/video-games/nintendo-switch-consoles/2636_1075591_1232576)
*   **GameStop:** [Link to GameStop's Nintendo Section](https://www.gamestop.com/consoles/nintendo-switch)
*   **Best Buy:** [Link to Best Buy's Nintendo Section](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo/nintendo-switch/pcmcat79800050008.c?id=pcmcat79800050008)
*   **Target:** [Link to Target's Nintendo Section](https://www.target.com/c/nintendo-video-games/-/N-5xu1q)
*   **Newegg:** [Link to Newegg's Nintendo Section](https://www.newegg.com/Nintendo-Switch-Consoles/SubCategory/ID-3501)
*   **Sam's Club:** [Link to Sam's Club's Nintendo Section](https://www.samsclub.com/b/nintendo-switch/16801002)

By regularly checking these pages, you'll be among the first to know when pre-orders resume.

### Understanding Your Options: Available Configurations

At launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to be available in two configurations:

*   **Standard Version:** Priced at $449.99, this is the base console.
*   **Mario Kart World Bundle:** Priced at $499.99, this bundle includes the standard console and a copy of *Mario Kart World*. 

Nintendo has indicated that the *Mario Kart World* bundle will be a limited-time offering, available through Fall 2025 or while supplies last. Purchasing the bundle saves you $30 compared to buying the console and game separately, as *Mario Kart World* is expected to retail for $79 on its own. 

Keep in mind that pricing is subject to change. Nintendo has previously adjusted prices for Joy-Cons and Pro Controllers due to tariffs and market conditions, and further adjustments are possible.

### Essential Tips for Pre-Order Success

Securing a Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order requires more than just luck. Here's a checklist of actions you can take to improve your chances:

#### 1. Create Accounts for Every Retailer

This is a no-brainer. Having an account set up *before* pre-orders go live will save you precious time. Ensure your shipping address and payment information are up-to-date. A few seconds can make all the difference when demand is high.

#### 2. Download the Mobile Apps

Many retailers offer mobile apps that can provide faster notifications and a streamlined checkout experience. Download the apps for Walmart, Best Buy, GameStop, and Target. Enable push notifications so you don't miss any announcements.

#### 3. Sign Up for Retailer Notifications

In addition to push notifications, sign up for email newsletters and SMS alerts from each retailer. This ensures you receive information through multiple channels, increasing the likelihood of catching the pre-order announcement.

#### 4. Skip the Accessories (Initially)

When pre-orders open, focus solely on securing the console itself. Adding accessories to your cart can slow down the checkout process and increase the risk of missing out. You can always purchase accessories later.

#### 5. Try Your Local Brick-and-Mortar Store

Don't underestimate the power of your local stores. Call your local GameStop, Best Buy, and Target locations to inquire about in-store pre-order availability. Some retailers may offer in-store pre-orders that aren't available online.

#### 6. Follow Us (and Others)

Stay informed by following reputable tech blogs, gaming news outlets, and social media accounts that provide updates on Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders. Set up notifications for these accounts to receive immediate alerts.

### Where to Monitor for Pre-Order Availability

Let's take a closer look at the retailers where you're most likely to find Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders:

#### My Nintendo Store

Nintendo's official store is a primary source for console pre-orders. Sign up for notifications and ensure your My Nintendo account is active.

#### Walmart

Walmart is a major retailer with a large online presence. Monitor their website and app closely for pre-order announcements.

#### GameStop

GameStop is a dedicated gaming retailer and often offers exclusive pre-order bonuses. Check their website, app, and local stores for availability.

#### Best Buy

Best Buy is a popular electronics retailer with a strong online and offline presence. Keep an eye on their website and app for pre-order updates.

#### Target

Target is a general merchandise retailer that also carries video game consoles. Monitor their website and app for pre-order announcements.

#### Newegg and Samâ€™s Club

While less traditional options, Newegg (electronics) and Sam's Club (membership warehouse) sometimes offer console pre-orders. It's worth checking their websites as well.

### Conclusion: Prepare for Success

The Nintendo Switch 2 is one of the most anticipated gaming consoles in recent memory. While the initial pre-order launch was challenging, you can increase your chances of securing a console by staying informed, preparing your accounts, and monitoring retailer websites and apps. By following the tips outlined in this guide, you'll be well-equipped to navigate the next wave of pre-orders and experience the next generation of Nintendo gaming.

Good luck, and happy gaming!
