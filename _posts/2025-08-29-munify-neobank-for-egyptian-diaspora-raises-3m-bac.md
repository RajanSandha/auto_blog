## Munify: Neobank for Egyptian Diaspora Raises $3M, Backed by Y Combinator

Tired of hefty fees and slow transfers when sending money back home? Munify, a new **neobank**, is aiming to solve that problem for the Egyptian diaspora. Founded by Khalid Ashmawy, an ex-Microsoft and Uber engineer, Munify recently secured $3 million in seed funding and gained acceptance into the prestigious Y Combinator program.

This isn't just another fintech startup; it's a solution born from personal experience. Ashmawy, while studying in Europe, faced the same challenges many Egyptians abroad encounter: expensive and time-consuming **remittances**.

### Solving a Personal Pain Point

Ashmawy's experience is a common one. Traditional methods of sending money, like bank wires, can be costly and slow. A simple $400 transfer could easily incur $40 in fees and take several business days to arrive. This inefficiency is what fueled Ashmawy's vision for Munify.

"Banking wasn’t built for people like me. It’s very costly, takes a long time, and is fragmented," Ashmawy told TechCrunch. "It’s a problem I have personally experienced and one that resonates with a lot of people who want to send money back home quickly and efficiently."

### What is Munify?

Munify is a **cross-border neobank** designed to provide Egyptians living abroad with a faster and more affordable way to send money home. It also aims to give residents in Egypt access to U.S. banking services.

Here’s a breakdown of what Munify offers:

*   **Faster, cheaper remittances:** Send money home instantly with better exchange rates.
*   **U.S. bank accounts for Egyptians:** Businesses, remote workers, and freelancers in Egypt can open U.S. bank accounts and obtain cards using just a local ID.
*   **Hedge against currency volatility:** Protect your money from fluctuations in the Egyptian pound.

### From Microsoft & Uber to Fintech Founder

Ashmawy's journey to becoming a fintech founder is impressive. After studying computer science and earning master's degrees in Europe, he spent seven years at tech giants Microsoft and Uber. He then launched Huspy, a proptech platform in the Middle East, before dedicating himself to Munify.

His experience at Huspy, backed by Founders Fund, gave him invaluable insight into the Middle Eastern market and the power of disruptive technologies.

### Why Y Combinator? And Why Now?

Y Combinator (YC) is known for backing innovative startups, often with a focus on AI and developer tools. Munify's acceptance into the program highlights the importance of solving real-world problems, regardless of the current tech trend. As Ashmawy puts it, "If you’re solving a big and urgent problem, that’s what really matters, regardless of whether the current wave is AI or something else."

YC has a history of investing in startups tackling financial infrastructure challenges, such as Stripe and Coinbase. Munify aligns with this tradition by addressing the persistent issue of **global remittances**.

### Building its Own Rails

What sets Munify apart from traditional remittance services? Ashmawy explains that they are building their own infrastructure. "The main reason why we’re different is that we’re building our own rails and directly connecting the banking systems across different countries," he said.

This direct connection allows Munify to offer lower fees and faster transfer times compared to competitors.

### Early Traction and Future Plans

Even though Munify launched just a few weeks ago, it's already seeing significant adoption through word of mouth. The platform has thousands of sign-ups and has signed contracts with mid-sized companies and enterprises, projecting over $50 million in monthly cross-border volume.

Looking ahead, Munify plans to expand beyond Egypt to other Middle Eastern countries, creating a regional banking network. The company's revenue model is based on foreign exchange spreads, interchange fees, and payment flows.

### The Future of Remittances in Egypt

Egypt is a major player in the global remittance market, receiving nearly $30 billion annually. While traditional methods still dominate, Munify hopes to become the go-to digital bank for Egyptians abroad seeking a more efficient and affordable way to send money home. Munify is trying to address a clear need in the **Egyptian diaspora**.

### Actionable Takeaway

If you're an Egyptian living abroad and regularly send money home, explore Munify as a potential alternative to traditional remittance services. Compare their fees and transfer times to your current methods to see if you can save money and time.
