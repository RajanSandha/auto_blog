Amazon Prime Day 2025 is just around the corner (July 8-11!), but the deals are already heating up! We've scoured Amazon to bring you the best early Prime Day discounts on products we've *actually* tested and recommend.

This year, Prime Day is expanding to a full four days, giving you double the time to snag those must-have items. From Apple Watches to Amazon Devices and beyond, let's dive into the early deals you can grab right now.

## Why Shop Early Prime Day Deals?

While the official Prime Day event is the big show, shopping early offers several advantages:

*   **Beat the Rush:** Avoid the frantic, last-minute scramble when everyone else is trying to snag the same deals.
