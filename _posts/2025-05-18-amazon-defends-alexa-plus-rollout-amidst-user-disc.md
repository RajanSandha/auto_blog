## Amazon Defends Alexa Plus Rollout Amidst User Discovery Challenges

The launch of Amazon's AI-enhanced Alexa Plus has been met with a mixture of anticipation and, more recently, some skepticism. A recent report by *Reuters* questioned the visibility of actual users engaging with the upgraded assistant, sparking a strong reaction from Amazon. Let's delve into the details of this developing story and see what's really happening with Alexa Plus.

### The Mystery of the Missing Users

The *Reuters* article, titled “Weeks after Amazon's Alexa+ AI launch, a mystery: where are the users?,” highlighted the news organization's difficulty in finding firsthand accounts of people actively using Alexa Plus. The article painted a picture of an AI assistant shrouded in secrecy, prompting questions about its actual availability and adoption.

*Reuters* reported extensive searches across various online platforms, including news sites, YouTube, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), BlueSky, Meta's Instagram and Facebook, Amazon's Twitch, and even reviews of Echo devices on Amazon.com. These efforts yielded little to no verifiable evidence of real-world Alexa Plus usage. The report also mentioned uncorroborated claims from Reddit users who allegedly used Alexa Plus but couldn't provide concrete evidence.

### Amazon's Response: A Firm Rebuttal

In response to *The Verge*'s inquiry about the *Reuters* report, Amazon issued a strongly worded statement, refuting the notion that Alexa Plus is unavailable. According to Amazon spokesperson Eric Sveum, the claim that Alexa Plus isn't accessible to customers is “simply wrong.”

Here's the full statement provided to *The Verge*:

> It’s simply wrong to say that Alexa+ isn’t available to customers—that assertion is false. Hundreds of thousands of customers have access to Alexa+ and we’re constantly inviting more customers that have requested Early Access.

This statement directly contradicts the implication that Alexa Plus is a ghost in the machine, suggesting that a significant number of users are, in fact, interacting with the AI-powered assistant.

### Inside the Alexa Plus Experience

Alexa Plus represents Amazon's foray into generative AI for its popular voice assistant. Announced earlier this year, the upgrade promises more natural and contextually aware conversations, enabling users to interact with Alexa in a more intuitive way. Amazon offers Alexa Plus as a free upgrade to Amazon Prime subscribers, while non-Prime members can access it for $19.99 per month.

### The Invitation Process: How to Get Access

Amazon's approach to rolling out Alexa Plus involves an invitation-based system. Users who have expressed interest in early access are gradually being invited to try out the new features. This controlled rollout allows Amazon to gather feedback and refine the AI model before a wider release. The company shared a screenshot of an example email invite:

### Conflicting Reports and the Reality of Early Access

While *Reuters* struggled to find users, *Engadget* reported that a fresh wave of invitations went out recently, further suggesting that Amazon is actively expanding the Alexa Plus user base. *Engadget* also cited an Amazon spokesperson stating that “hundreds of thousands” of customers have already experienced the upgraded assistant.

The conflicting reports highlight the challenges of tracking an early access program. While many users may have access, their usage patterns and online presence might not be easily discoverable. Additionally, the initial rollout has been gradual and targeted, focusing on users who have specifically requested early access.

### Missing Features and Future Development

Amazon's early access program for Alexa Plus began in late March, but even then, some key features were still under development. For example, the ability to order takeout from Grubhub using conversational context and the feature to identify family members and remind them of their chores were initially unavailable. According to a page on Amazon’s website, some features are still “coming soon,” including web browser and Fire TV/Amazon tablet access. The company is also prioritizing users with certain Echo Show devices.

These missing features could also contribute to the perception of limited use. If the features that truly differentiate Alexa Plus are not yet fully implemented, users may not be compelled to share their experiences publicly.

### Conclusion: Alexa Plus is Real, But Still Evolving

Despite the initial mystery surrounding its user base, it's clear that Alexa Plus is indeed available to a growing number of customers. Amazon's firm rebuttal to the *Reuters* report, coupled with *Engadget*'s reporting on the recent wave of invitations, suggests that the AI-powered assistant is actively being tested and refined.

However, the limited availability of certain features and the controlled rollout strategy may contribute to the perception of limited user engagement. As Amazon continues to expand access and add new capabilities, we can expect to see more real-world accounts of Alexa Plus in action. For now, the story serves as a reminder that even in the age of AI, a successful product launch requires more than just technological prowess; it also demands effective communication and a clear understanding of user expectations.
