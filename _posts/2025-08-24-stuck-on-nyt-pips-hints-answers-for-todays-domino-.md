### What is NYT Pips?

Pips is a single-player game from the New York Times Games. It uses domino tiles but with a color-coded twist. Instead of matching numbers like in traditional dominoes, you have to meet specific conditions based on the colors on the board. It's a great way to challenge your brain and have some fun!

### How to Play Pips: A Quick Guide

If you're familiar with dominoes, you'll pick up Pips quickly. Here's the basic idea:

*   Tiles are placed vertically or horizontally, connecting with each other.
*   The main difference is the color-coded spaces, each with a specific condition.
*   Tiles touching color-coded spaces don't necessarily have to match numerically.

**Understanding the Color Codes**

The color codes are key to solving the puzzle. Here's a breakdown of common conditions:

*   **Number:** All the pips (dots) in that colored space must add up to the indicated number.
*   **Equal:** Every domino half within the colored space must have the same number of pips.
*   **Not Equal:** Every domino half must have a different number of pips.
*   **Less Than:** Every domino half must have a pip count less than the indicated number.
*   **Greater Than:** Every domino half must have a pip count greater than the indicated number.

If a space has no color coding, there are no conditions for the tiles within that space.
