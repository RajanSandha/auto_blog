One of the most compelling relationships in the series is between Murderbot, the security android, and Dr. Gurathin, an augmented human with a troubled past.

### Gurathin's Journey: From Distrust to Understanding

Initially, Gurathin is wary of Murderbot. His past experiences with the Company, marked by coercion and addiction, have made him cautious and distrustful. He views Murderbot with suspicion, questioning its motives and behavior. Dastmalchian explains that Gurathin's guarded nature stems from a need for control, a way to protect himself and those he cares about.

As the season progresses, Gurathin begins to see beyond Murderbot's SecUnit programming. He witnesses its acts of selflessness and its growing sense of independence. This shift in perspective culminates in Gurathin's willingness to help Murderbot regain its memories after they're wiped by the Company. This act of kindness marks a turning point in their relationship, signifying a deep level of trust and understanding.

### The Parting Scene: A Meaningful Farewell

The final scene between Gurathin and Murderbot is particularly poignant. Dr. Mensah has bought out Murderbot's contract, offering it the opportunity to live freely within the Preservation Alliance. However, Murderbot chooses a different path, opting to explore the universe and make its own decisions.

Gurathin, understanding Murderbot's need for independence, offers a simple yet profound farewell: "You need to check the perimeter." This line, initially a phrase associated with Murderbot's security duties, now carries a deeper meaning. It acknowledges Murderbot's desire to break free and forge its own destiny. 

### Dastmalchian's Personal Connection

Dastmalchian revealed that the scene resonated with his own experiences, particularly the bittersweet feeling of saying goodbye to loved ones. He spoke of the close bond he formed with the *Murderbot* cast and crew, making the farewell scene all the more impactful.

"The family that I'd grown to love in making the showâ€¦ we were very close," Dastmalchian shared. "When we reach that moment where [Gurathin] is saying... 'I just broke through a level of understanding about you, and now I have to let you go,' it's hard... Relationships end. Sometimes people have to go away, sometimes for themselves, and that kind of acceptance hit me in the moment."

### Actionable Takeaway: Embrace Change and Understanding

The relationship between Gurathin and Murderbot teaches us the importance of embracing change and understanding others, even those who seem different from us. By overcoming initial biases and fostering empathy, we can build meaningful connections and support each other's journeys, even when those journeys lead us in separate directions. Just like Gurathin, we can learn to accept that sometimes the best thing we can do for someone we care about is to let them go and pursue their own path.
