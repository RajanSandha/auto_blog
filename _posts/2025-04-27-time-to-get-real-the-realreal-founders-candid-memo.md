## Time to Get Real: The RealReal Founder's Candid Memoir on Leadership

Julie Wainwright, the force behind The RealReal, has achieved a feat that few can claim: taking not one, but two companies public. While that accomplishment alone is impressive, Wainwright is now offering something potentially even more valuable to the business world: a brutally honest look at the often-unseen realities of leadership. Her new memoir, *Time to Get Real*, promises a behind-the-scenes perspective, filled with the kind of raw truths that many CEOs understand intimately but rarely discuss publicly.

### Beyond the IPO: A Glimpse Behind the Curtain

We often see CEOs celebrated for their successes â€“ the innovative products, the soaring stock prices, and the company's growth. What we rarely see are the sleepless nights, the agonizing decisions, the constant pressure, and the personal sacrifices that come with the territory. *Time to Get Real* aims to peel back the layers of carefully crafted public image and reveal the human being behind the title.

Wainwright's journey to success hasn't been a straight line. Her career has been marked by both triumphs and setbacks, and it's this experience that lends credibility to her insights. The book reportedly delves into the challenges of navigating a male-dominated industry, the complexities of scaling a business, and the importance of building a strong and resilient team. It's not just a success story; it's a story of resilience, adaptation, and learning from mistakes.

### The Value of Authenticity in Leadership

In an era where authenticity is increasingly valued, Wainwright's willingness to be vulnerable and share her experiences is particularly refreshing.
