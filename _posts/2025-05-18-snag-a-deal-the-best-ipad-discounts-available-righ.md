## Current iPad Deals

### The Best iPad (10th Generation) Deals

Released in late 2022, the 10th-generation iPad remains a capable tablet. While it's been superseded by the 11th-generation model, its modern design, USB-C port, and side-mounted fingerprint sensor make it a worthwhile option, especially at a discounted price. It boasts a 10.9-inch display, uniform bezels, and is powered by the A14 Bionic chip.

Currently, you can find the 64GB model at **Walmart** for around $299. While not the lowest price ever, it's still a solid deal. Keep an eye out for deals on the 256GB model as well, as it can offer better value depending on the discount.

### The Best iPad (11th Generation) Deals

The 11th-generation iPad is a modest upgrade over its predecessor, offering 128GB of base storage and the A16 Bionic chip, resulting in a performance boost. It's an excellent choice for users who want a modern iPad experience without breaking the bank. 

Look for deals at **Amazon** and **Walmart**. Prices often fluctuate, so check regularly to snag the best offer. You can sometimes find the base model for around $299. Higher storage configurations (256GB and 512GB) are also occasionally discounted, so be sure to compare prices and choose the option that best suits your storage needs. 

### The Best iPad Mini (7th Generation) Deals

The 7th-generation iPad Mini offers improvements over the previous model, including faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, Apple Pencil Pro support, and the A17 Pro chip. It's the perfect choice for those who prioritize portability and want a powerful tablet in a compact form factor. Its small size makes it ideal for reading, note-taking, and on-the-go entertainment.

### The Best iPad Air (6th Generation) Deals

The latest iPad Air comes in two sizes, 11-inch and 13-inch, and both are powered by the M2 chip. The larger model is perfect for anyone who wants a bigger canvas for drawing or split screen multitasking. 

Check **Amazon** and **Best Buy** for deals on the iPad Air. 

### The Best iPad Pro (M4) Deals

The iPad Pro with the M4 chip is Apple's most powerful and advanced tablet. It features a stunning Ultra Retina XDR display and offers unparalleled performance for demanding tasks like video editing, graphic design, and gaming. If you need the best of the best, the iPad Pro is the way to go.

Look for deals at major retailers like **Amazon**, **Best Buy**, and **Apple's own website** (refurbished models). Given its premium price point, any discount on the iPad Pro is worth considering.

## Tips for Finding the Best iPad Deals

*   **Monitor Prices Regularly:** iPad prices can fluctuate, so check major retailers frequently.
*   **Compare Prices:** Don't settle for the first deal you see. Compare prices across different retailers to ensure you're getting the best offer.
*   **Consider Refurbished Models:** Apple offers certified refurbished iPads at a discounted price. These devices are thoroughly tested and come with a warranty.
*   **Check for Bundles:** Sometimes, retailers offer bundles that include accessories like keyboards or Apple Pencils at a discounted price.
*   **Set Price Alerts:** Use price tracking websites or apps to receive notifications when the price of your desired iPad drops.
