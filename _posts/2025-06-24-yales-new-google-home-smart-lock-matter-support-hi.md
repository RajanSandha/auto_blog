## Yale's New Google Home Smart Lock: Matter Support, Higher Price Tag

Smart home enthusiasts, get ready! Yale is launching its new **Yale Smart Lock with Matter**, designed specifically for seamless integration with Google Home. But there's a slight catch: the price. Initially announced at a lower price point, it's now hitting the market at $189.99. Let's dive into what this smart lock offers and why the price has increased.

### What is Matter and Why Does It Matter?

Before we delve deeper, let's talk about **Matter**. Matter is a new, unified connectivity standard designed to make smart home devices work together more seamlessly, regardless of the manufacturer. It's a big deal because it promises to eliminate the frustration of dealing with incompatible devices. The Yale Smart Lock leverages **Matter-over-Thread**, which offers improved reliability and faster response times compared to traditional Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections.

### Launch Details and Price Increase

The Yale Smart Lock with Matter is launching on June 24th and will be available on  and . While the features remain the same as initially announced, the price has increased by $20 due to tariffs, according to Yale. Catelyn Herman, senior product manager at Yale, confirmed that “tariff costs and overall product costs led us to have to increase the price slightly.”

### Designed for Google Home, Compatible with Everyone

While designed with Google Home in mind and to complement Nest video doorbells, the Yale Smart Lock's **Matter**-over-Thread connectivity ensures compatibility with other major smart home platforms. This includes:

*   Apple Home
*   Amazon Alexa
*   Samsung SmartThings
*   Home Assistant

This broad compatibility makes it a versatile choice for any smart home setup.

### Features and Functionality

The Yale Smart Lock with Matter offers a range of features designed to enhance your home's security and convenience:

*   **Multiple Control Methods:** Input codes on the backlit push-button keypad, use a physical key, or control it remotely via the Google Home app (or other Matter-compatible apps).
*   **Voice Control:** Lock and unlock the door using voice commands via Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or Apple's Siri. You can even unlock Matter locks using a voice PIN code via Google Assistant.
*   **Long Battery Life:** Promised 12 months of battery life on 4 AA batteries, thanks to Matter-over-Thread's energy efficiency.
*   **Auto-Lock Feature:** Ensures your door is always locked, providing peace of mind. Note that it *doesn't* have an auto-unlock feature like the Yale Assure 2 line.
*   **Keyway Included:** Unlike the discontinued Nest x Yale lock, this model includes a keyway, providing a traditional backup entry method.

### Integration with Google Home

Jesse Stroh, product manager at Google Home and Nest, highlighted the lock's deep integration with the Google Home platform. This includes:

*   Creating and editing access codes, including guest codes with set schedules.
*   Viewing lock activity in the Home app's activity feed.
*   Receiving lock and unlock notifications.

### What's Missing?

Unlike the Nest x Yale lock, the new Yale Smart Lock won't integrate with any security system at launch. This is a notable difference, especially given Yale and Google's existing relationships with home security companies like ADT. The Nest x Yale lock used to disarm Google's Nest Secure security system.

### Design and Availability

The Yale Smart Lock with Matter is available in white and black, with a gray version coming this fall. The inclusion of a push-button keypad and a physical key option reflects Yale's research into user preferences, although some may prefer a sleeker, keyhole-free design.

### The Competition

The Yale Smart Lock with Matter joins a growing market of full-deadbolt replacement locks that support the Matter protocol. Competitors include:

*   Kwikset Halo Select
*   Level Lock Plus
*   Eufy E30
*   U-tec’s Matter lock
*   Yale’s Assure SL

### Is the Yale Smart Lock with Matter Right for You?

If you're looking for a smart lock that offers seamless integration with Google Home, broad compatibility with other smart home platforms, and enhanced security features, the Yale Smart Lock with Matter is worth considering. However, be mindful of the slightly higher price point due to tariffs.

Consider your existing smart home ecosystem, your budget, and your preferred control methods when making your decision. With Matter becoming increasingly prevalent, investing in a Matter-compatible device like the **Yale Smart Lock** can future-proof your smart home setup.
