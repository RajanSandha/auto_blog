## Pintarnya Secures $16.7M to Empower Indonesian Workers

An Indonesian startup called Pintarnya is making waves by securing $16.7 million in Series A funding. But what exactly does Pintarnya do? It's more than just a job board. They're building a platform to connect Indonesian workers with both full-time and side-gig opportunities, all while providing access to crucial financial services.

This funding round was led by Square Peg, with participation from existing investors like Vertex Venture Southeast Asia & India and East Ventures. This significant investment highlights the growing recognition of the need to support Indonesia's workforce, particularly those in the informal sector.

### Addressing a Critical Need in Indonesia

Founded in 2022 by Ghirish Pokardas, Nelly Nurmalasari, and Henry Hendrawan, Pintarnya is tackling two major challenges faced by many Indonesians: earning a sufficient income and accessing responsible borrowing options. The founders recognized that traditional methods of job searching and financial services often leave a large segment of the population underserved.

"Traditionally, mass workers in Indonesia find jobs offline through job fairs or word of mouth, with employers buried in paper applications and candidates rarely hearing back. For borrowing, their options are often limited to family/friend or predatory lenders with harsh collection practices," explained Henry Hendrawan, co-founder of Pintarnya.

### The Challenge of the Informal Sector

A staggering 59% of Indonesia's 150 million-strong workforce operates in the informal sector. This means many workers lack the verifiable income and official documentation needed to access traditional financial services. Pintarnya is bridging this gap by partnering with asset-backed lenders to offer secured loans, using collateral like gold, electronics, or vehicles.

### How Pintarnya is Different

While other job platforms exist in Indonesia, like JobStreet, Kalibrr, and Glints, these tend to focus on white-collar positions. Pintarnya is specifically designed for blue-collar workers, offering a tailored experience that includes:

*   **Quick-apply options for walk-in interviews:** Streamlining the application process for immediate opportunities.
*   **Affordable e-learning on relevant skills:** Helping workers upskill and improve their earning potential.
*   **In-app opportunities for supplemental income:** Providing access to side gigs and additional earning streams.
*   **Seamless connections to financial services like loans:** Offering safe and accessible borrowing options.

### AI-Powered Job Matching

Pintarnya leverages AI to speed up the hiring process, making it easier for both employers and job seekers to find the right match. This technology helps connect workers with opportunities that align with their skills and experience, while also providing employers with a more efficient way to source talent.

### Financial Services Tailored to the Underserved

Pintarnya's approach to financial services is equally innovative. Recognizing that traditional credit scoring models often exclude blue-collar workers, they're developing solutions that cater to the unique needs of this segment.

"We digitize job matching with AI to make hiring faster and we provide workers with safer, healthier lending options — designed around what they can reasonably afford, rather than pushing them deeper into debt,” Hendrawan said.

### The Future of Pintarnya

With this new funding, Pintarnya plans to strengthen its platform technology and expand its financial service offerings through strategic partnerships. They envision becoming the go-to super app for Indonesian workers, offering not only job opportunities but also tools for skills development and financial well-being.

Their goal is to help Indonesians "not only make ends meet today, but also plan, grow, and upgrade their lives tomorrow."

**Actionable Takeaway:** If you're a tech company looking to expand into emerging markets, consider focusing on solutions that address the specific needs of underserved populations. Pintarnya's success demonstrates the potential of tailoring technology to meet the unique challenges faced by blue-collar workers and those in the informal sector.
