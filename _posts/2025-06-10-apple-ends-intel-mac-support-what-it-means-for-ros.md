## Apple Bids Farewell to Intel Macs: The Future is Apple Silicon

Apple has officially announced the end of an era: support for Intel-based Macs is coming to a close. With the upcoming macOS 27, the company is making a definitive shift, requiring all new releases to run exclusively on **Apple Silicon**. This move signals a major turning point, leaving users with Intel Macs facing a sunset for their beloved machines.

### The Final macOS for Intel: macOS Tahoe

macOS Tahoe will be the last macOS release to support any Intel Macs. While the support list for Tahoe included a select few Intel models (specifically those released in 2019 or 2020), it's now clear that Apple is fully committed to its own silicon. This means no more new features or major updates for Intel Macs beyond macOS Tahoe.

### Security Updates Until 2028

Don't panic just yet! Apple will continue to provide security updates for macOS Tahoe until the fall of 2028. This is a standard practice for older macOS versions, ensuring your Intel Mac remains protected from vulnerabilities for a couple more years. You can expect one year of major point updates (including security fixes and new features) followed by two years of security-only updates.

### Rosetta 2 Phaseout: A Gradual Transition

What about all those Intel-based apps? Apple introduced **Rosetta 2**, an impressive Intel-to-Arm app translation technology, to smooth the transition between the two architectures. The good news is that Rosetta 2 will continue to function in both macOS 26 and macOS 27, allowing you to run your existing Intel apps on your Apple Silicon Macs. However, it's important to note that Rosetta 2 is not intended to be a permanent solution. Apple plans to eventually phase it out completely.

### What This Means for You

So, what does all of this mean for you, the Mac user?

*   **If you own an Intel Mac:** You'll continue to receive security updates for macOS Tahoe until 2028. However, you won't be able to upgrade to future macOS versions beyond Tahoe.
*   **If you're planning to buy a new Mac:** Opt for an Apple Silicon model. It's the future of macOS and will ensure you receive the latest features and updates.
*   **If you rely on Intel-based apps:** Rosetta 2 will allow you to run them on Apple Silicon Macs for now. However, it's wise to start exploring native Apple Silicon alternatives to ensure long-term compatibility.

### The Rise of Apple Silicon: A Strategic Move

Apple's transition to its own silicon has been a strategic success. Apple Silicon offers significant performance and efficiency gains compared to Intel processors. This allows Apple to deliver faster, more power-efficient Macs with longer battery life. By focusing solely on Apple Silicon, Apple can further optimize its hardware and software for a seamless user experience.

### Key Takeaways

*   macOS Tahoe is the last macOS version to support Intel Macs.
*   Security updates for macOS Tahoe will continue until fall 2028.
*   Rosetta 2 will continue to function in macOS 26 and macOS 27.
*   Apple is fully committed to Apple Silicon for future Macs.

### Preparing for the Future

The end of Intel Mac support is a significant milestone in Apple's history. While it may be bittersweet for some, it also represents an exciting future for macOS powered by Apple Silicon. As an Intel Mac user, itâ€™s time to consider your options and prepare for the transition. Explore Apple Silicon Macs and ensure the software you depend on is compatible. Apple has made a clear statement about the direction they are headed, and staying informed is the best way to navigate this shift.
