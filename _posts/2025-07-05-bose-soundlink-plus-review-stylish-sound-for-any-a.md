## Bose Soundlink Plus Review: Stylish Sound for Any Adventure

Looking for a Bluetooth speaker that sounds great and looks good too? The Bose Soundlink Plus might be just what you need. It's a mid-size speaker that packs a punch, delivering clear and detailed audio with a robust bass. In this review, we'll dive into what makes the Soundlink Plus a worthwhile option, exploring its design, features, and sound quality.

### Design and Build Quality

The Soundlink Plus boasts a sleek and stylish design. The powder-coated steel grille and rubberized top give it a premium feel. It’s available in several colors, including a vibrant Citrus Yellow. The integrated nylon handle makes it easy to carry around, and its IP67 rating means it's dustproof and waterproof – even floats! While it's not the most compact speaker, it strikes a good balance between portability and powerful sound. It measures 9.1 x 3.94 x 3.4 inches (WxHxD) and weighs over 3 pounds.

*   **Premium Materials:** Steel grille and rubberized top.
*   **Portable Design:** Easy-to-carry handle.
*   **Durability:** IP67 dustproof and waterproof.

### Sound Quality

When it comes to sound, the Soundlink Plus truly shines. It delivers a balanced and detailed audio experience with a surprising amount of bass for its size. Whether you're listening to music, podcasts, or audiobooks, you'll appreciate the clarity and richness of the sound. The dual-driver system provides full-throttle power and bass, with lovely moments of lyricism and detail, especially in the upper midrange and treble.

### Features and Functionality

The Soundlink Plus offers a range of features to enhance your listening experience. The Bose app allows you to connect to two devices via Bluetooth multipoint, customize the sound with a three-band EQ, and monitor battery life. You can also link it with other Bose speakers for a multi-room audio setup. Android users will appreciate Google Fast Pair and aptX Adaptive support for high-quality Bluetooth streaming.

*   **Bluetooth Multipoint:** Connect two devices simultaneously.
*   **Customizable EQ:** Fine-tune the sound to your preferences.
*   **Bose App Integration:** Easy control and monitoring.
*   **Google Fast Pair & aptX Adaptive:** Enhanced Android connectivity.

One unique feature is the ability to customize one of the top control keys to either link with other Bose speakers or act as a Spotify quick key. This provides added convenience for your listening habits.

### Battery Life and Charging

Bose claims a 20-hour battery life at moderate volume levels, which is fairly accurate based on tests. However, cranking up the volume will reduce the playtime to around 15 hours or less. One downside is the relatively slow charging time of five hours from zero to full. The Soundlink Plus can also charge other devices via its USB-C port, which is a handy feature for on-the-go charging.

### What's Missing?

While the Soundlink Plus excels in many areas, it does lack a few features found in some competing speakers. It doesn't have a built-in speakerphone, an aux input, or support for Auracast audio sharing. While Auracast isn't widely adopted yet, it's a future-proof feature that would have been a nice addition.

### Actionable Takeaway

**Tip:** Take advantage of the customizable EQ in the Bose app to tailor the sound to your preferences. Experiment with different settings to find the perfect balance for your favorite music genres.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

*   Excellent sound quality with clear detail and robust bass
*   Stylish and durable design with IP67 water resistance
*   Bluetooth multipoint and customizable EQ
*   Bose app integration and Google Fast Pair support

**Cons:**

*   Relatively slow charging time
*   Lacks speakerphone and aux input
*   No Auracast support

### Alternatives to Consider

If you're looking for alternatives to the Bose Soundlink Plus, consider the JBL Charge 6 or the UE MegaBoom 4. The JBL Charge 6 offers similar sound quality and battery life, while the UE MegaBoom 4 is known for its ruggedness and 360-degree sound.
