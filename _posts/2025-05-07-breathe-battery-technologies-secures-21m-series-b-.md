## Breathe Battery Technologies Secures $21M Series B to Revolutionize Battery Performance Prediction

The electric vehicle (EV) revolution is in full swing, and at the heart of this transformation lies the battery. As automakers race to electrify their fleets, the pressure to optimize battery performance, lifespan, and charging speed has never been greater. Enter Breathe Battery Technologies, a UK-based startup that's tackling these challenges head-on with its innovative suite of software tools. Recently, Breathe announced a successful $21 million Series B funding round, led by Kinnevik Online AB, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital and Volvo Cars Tech Fund, signaling strong confidence in their vision. This funding will fuel their mission to empower automakers and other industries to unlock the full potential of their batteries.

### The Accelerating Pace of EV Development

In the fast-paced world of automotive innovation, particularly in markets like China, development cycles are shrinking dramatically. New models are being launched in as little as 18 months, a stark contrast to the four-plus years it often takes Western automakers to bring a concept to market. This accelerated timeline places immense pressure on manufacturers to optimize every aspect of their vehicles, and batteries are a critical focal point. As Ian Campbell, co-founder and CEO of Breathe Battery Technologies, aptly put it, the industry is experiencing a "huge amount of cost and time focus." Automakers need to anticipate future market demands, but rapid advancements in battery technology and the evolving EV landscape make accurate forecasting a significant challenge.

### Software: The Key to Battery Flexibility

Making physical changes to battery components is often an expensive and time-consuming process. Breathe Battery Technologies proposes a more agile and efficient solution: software. By leveraging sophisticated algorithms and simulations, Breathe aims to provide batteries with greater flexibility and adaptability. Their suite of tools is designed to help automakers and other businesses maximize the performance, lifespan, and charging capabilities of their batteries.

### Breathe's Four Pillars: Design, Model, Map, and Charge

Breathe's comprehensive approach is embodied in its four key products:

*   **Charge:** This was Breathe's initial offering, focusing on optimizing charging strategies to either accelerate charging times or extend battery longevity. By intelligently managing the charging process, Charge aims to deliver the best possible performance based on specific user needs and preferences.
*   **Model:** Breathe Model provides customers with a simulation of the battery's performance based on tests run in Breathe's London lab. Within four weeks, Breathe can give customers an understanding of their battery's future performance.
*   **Map:** This product augments the simulated data from Breathe Model with real-world results, giving customers a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of their battery's capabilities.
*   **Design:** The Design product, slated for release in the coming months, will provide customers with a powerful set of software tools to streamline and accelerate battery design. This will enable faster iteration and optimization of battery systems.

### Real-World Impact: From Mobile Phones to Electric Sedans

The effectiveness of Breathe's technology is already being demonstrated in various applications. Chinese mobile phone manufacturer Oppo was an early adopter of the Charge software, achieving a remarkable 27% reduction in charging time. In the automotive sector, Volvo is integrating Breathe's code into its upcoming ES90 sedan, enabling a rapid 10% to 80% charge in just 20 minutes. This showcases the potential of Breathe's software to optimize charging performance and enhance the overall EV experience.

### Predicting the Future of Battery Performance

Beyond optimizing charging, Breathe's tools also help automakers and electronics companies predict the long-term performance of their batteries. This allows them to make informed decisions about where to allocate development resources. For example, if a new battery chemistry offers lower costs and a longer lifespan, designers might choose to prioritize those benefits, even if it means slightly faster charging times. By providing insights into these trade-offs, Breathe empowers manufacturers to make strategic decisions that align with their specific goals.

### A Lab-Based Approach to Data-Driven Insights

To generate accurate performance predictions, Breathe operates a state-of-the-art laboratory in London. Here, they conduct a wide range of tests on batteries that their customers are considering using. Within as little as four weeks, Breathe can gather enough data to create a model that simulates the likely future performance of the battery. The cells then remain in the lab, continuously contributing data to refine the model and provide even more accurate insights. This data-driven approach allows Breathe to deliver highly reliable and actionable information to its customers.

### From Brute Force Testing to Sophisticated Simulation

Ian Campbell emphasizes that Breathe's ultimate goal is to reduce the reliance on "brute force lab testing" in the battery development process. He draws a parallel to the semiconductor industry, where simulation software from companies like Cadence and Synopsis has revolutionized chip design. These tools enable companies like Apple and Nvidia to collaborate closely with foundries like TSMC, seamlessly translating their processor designs into silicon. Breathe aims to replicate this success in the battery industry, providing manufacturers with the tools they need to design, simulate, and optimize battery performance with unprecedented efficiency.

### The Road Ahead

With the fresh injection of $21 million in Series B funding, Breathe Battery Technologies is well-positioned to accelerate its growth and expand its impact on the battery industry. By providing automakers and other businesses with the tools they need to unlock the full potential of their batteries, Breathe is playing a crucial role in driving the electric vehicle revolution and shaping the future of sustainable transportation. As the demand for high-performance, long-lasting, and fast-charging batteries continues to grow, Breathe's innovative software solutions will become increasingly essential for companies looking to stay ahead of the curve.

Breathe's technology is poised to transform not only the automotive industry but also other sectors that rely on batteries, such as consumer electronics, energy storage, and grid management. By enabling more efficient battery design, optimization, and prediction, Breathe is contributing to a more sustainable and electrified future.
