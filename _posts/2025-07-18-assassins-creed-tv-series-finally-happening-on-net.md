After years of waiting, the *Assassin's Creed* TV series is officially happening! Netflix has given the green light to a live-action adaptation of the hugely popular video game franchise. This is exciting news for fans who have been eagerly anticipating this project since it was first announced back in 2020.

## A Long Journey to the Screen

The road to getting this series made has been a long one. The project has seen multiple creative teams come and go. But it looks like Netflix has finally found the right combination to bring the world of *Assassin's Creed* to life.

## Who's Behind the Camera?

So, who's in charge of making this happen? Netflix has tapped Roberto Patino (known for his work on *Sons of Anarchy* and *Westworld*) and David Wiener (who led Paramount+'s *Halo* TV series and worked on *Fear the Walking Dead*) as co-showrunners. This pairing brings a wealth of experience in creating compelling and action-packed television.

## What to Expect?

While details are still scarce, the series promises to bring the rich history, intricate plots, and thrilling action of the *Assassin's Creed* games to a new audience. Imagine parkour across ancient cities, hidden blades, and the ongoing battle between assassins and Templars â€“ all brought to life with high-quality production and compelling storytelling.

The co-showrunners have expressed their enthusiasm for the project, hinting at a faithful adaptation that will also offer something new for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. This is a crucial point, as pleasing both groups is essential for the show's success.

## Potential Challenges
