## Simplify Your Charging Setup with Anker's Dual USB-C Cable

Tired of juggling multiple cables when you need to charge your devices? Anker has a solution: their 2-in-1 USB-C cable, and it's currently available at a fantastic discount. This clever cable allows you to charge two devices simultaneously from a single power source, streamlining your charging setup and reducing clutter. Let's dive into the details of this deal and other notable tech discounts you might want to check out.

### Anker's 2-in-1 USB-C Cable: Power Up Two Devices with Ease

Anker's braided USB-C cable boasts a unique design with two USB-C connectors, allowing you to charge two devices from one power adapter. The four-foot version is currently priced at just $17.99 on Amazon, a significant drop from its usual price range of $23 to $25.99. If you need a bit more length, the six-foot option is also on sale for $19.99. Both sizes are available in classic black and white.



But the convenience doesn't stop there. This cable supports up to 140W charging when a single connector is in use, provided you have a compatible power brick or portable battery, like the Ugreen model. This high power delivery makes it capable of quickly charging even power-hungry devices like 16-inch MacBook Pro models. 

### Power Distribution Explained

Wondering how the cable manages power distribution when charging two devices? Anker provides a helpful chart that outlines the power allocation based on the power brick or battery you're using. This transparency ensures you know exactly how your devices are being charged.

### Beyond Cables: Other Notable Tech Deals

While you're upgrading your charging setup, here are some other deals across various tech categories that might pique your interest:

## Criterion Collection Sale: 30% Off Your Favorite Films

Film buffs, rejoice! Criterion is offering a generous 30% discount on all of its releases through May 26th. This includes both new releases and pre-orders, providing a perfect opportunity to expand your collection with high-quality DVDs or 4K Blu-rays of classic and contemporary films.

Consider snagging *Anora*, the recent Best Picture award winner. Or, if you're intrigued by the upcoming Spike Lee film *Highest 2 Lowest* (starring Denzel Washington), check out Akira Kurosawa's thriller *High and Low*, which serves as the inspiration for the new movie.

## Gaming Monitor Deals: High Refresh Rates at Lower Prices

For PC gamers, there are some compelling deals on high-refresh-rate OLED gaming monitors. Whether you're leaning towards a blistering 480Hz or a smooth 240Hz display, there are options to consider:

*   **LG 27GX790A-B (27-inch, 1440p, 480Hz):** This monitor boasts a 480Hz refresh rate and DisplayPort 2.1 and is currently available for $799.99 at Amazon (a $200 discount).
*   **Alienware AW2725Q (27-inch, 4K, 240Hz):** If you prefer a higher resolution, Alienware's 4K monitor with a 240Hz refresh rate is priced at just $829.99.

This TV features HDMI 2.1 ports for high refresh rates from consoles and PCs and boasts over 1,500 local dimming zones for improved picture quality.
