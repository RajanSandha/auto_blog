## Protest Safely: Digital Security & Surveillance in the Modern Age

Planning to exercise your right to protest? In today's world, it's crucial to consider not just your physical safety, but also your digital security. Law enforcement agencies have increasingly sophisticated tools for tracking movements and accessing communications. This guide provides practical steps to protect your privacy while voicing your concerns.

We'll explore how to minimize your digital footprint and safeguard your personal information during protests, covering everything from your smartphone to potential surveillance tactics. Let's dive in!

## Understanding the Surveillance Landscape

The reality is that **surveillance** is a significant factor at modern protests. Authorities can leverage various technologies to monitor and track individuals, making it essential to understand the risks and take proactive measures.

Two key areas of concern for protestors include:

*   **Phone Data:** Information that authorities can extract from your phone if detained or arrested.
*   **Identifying Information:** Data produced while attending a protest, including wireless communications, license plate data, and facial recognition information.

Police have shown a willingness to arrest and target protestors, making digital security a paramount concern. Assume that any digital evidence linking you to a protest could potentially be used against you.

As Evan Greer, the deputy director of the activist organization Fight for the Future, notes, governments are "weaponizing essentially every lever of government to shut down, suppress, and curtail criticism...and there have never been more surveillance toys available to law enforcement."

### Simple Steps, Significant Impact

The good news is that simple, concrete steps can significantly reduce your risk. These steps make it much harder for anyone to intercept your communications, track your location, or access your private information.

## Phone Security: The First Line of Defense

Your phone is a treasure trove of personal information, making it a prime target for **surveillance**. The most critical decision you'll make is whether to bring your phone at all. 

### Should You Bring Your Phone?

A smartphone broadcasts identifying information, and law enforcement can compel mobile carriers to provide data about cell tower connections. Police also use IMSI catchers (stingrays) to impersonate cell towers and collect mobile subscriber identity numbers, undermining the anonymity of entire crowds.

Harlo Holmes, director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, suggests leaving your primary phone at home if anonymity is a priority. If you need a phone for coordination or emergencies, keep it off as much as possible to minimize connections to rogue cell towers or Wi-Fi hotspots used for surveillance.

Consider these options:

*   **Leave Your Phone at Home:** The safest option for complete anonymity.
*   **Minimize Usage:** Keep your phone off as much as possible.
*   **Faraday Bag:** Store your phone in a Faraday bag to block all radio communications. .

### The Burner Phone Dilemma

Using a burner phone seems like a straightforward solution. However, purchasing a prepaid phone doesn't guarantee anonymity. If you provide identifying details to the carrier, your "burner" phone is no more secure than your primary device. Don't assume you're automatically untraceable just because you bought a cheap phone.

### A More Practical Approach: The Secondary Phone

Instead of a burner, consider using a secondary phone with limited personal data. Remove sensitive accounts and apps, such as social media, email, and messaging apps, to minimize the information accessible if the phone is seized.

### Encrypted Communication is Key

Regardless of the phone you use, traditional calls and text messages are vulnerable to surveillance. Use end-to-end **encryption** for all communications. 

**Signal** is a highly recommended encrypted messaging and calling app with a strong track record. . Ensure that all parties use the same app, as these apps are not interoperable. Use disappearing messages set to self-delete after a few hours or days.

### Protecting Your Phone from Seizure

Prepare for the possibility of police seizing your device and attempting to unlock it. Ensure your smartphone's contents are encrypted. iOS devices typically have full disk encryption enabled by default. Android devices also offer encryption options that you should enable in settings.

Use a strong, unique passcode. Avoid using facial recognition or fingerprint unlock, as these can be compelled by law enforcement. A strong alphanumeric password is the most secure option.

## Beyond Your Phone: Broader Security Measures

Protecting your phone is just one piece of the puzzle. Consider these additional measures to enhance your overall **privacy** and security during a protest.

### Disable Biometrics

As mentioned above, disabling facial recognition and fingerprint unlock is crucial. Law enforcement can compel you to unlock your phone using biometrics, but it's more difficult to force you to reveal a passcode.

### Turn Off Location Services

Disable location services on your phone to prevent tracking. Most smartphones allow you to disable location services globally or for specific apps.

### Use a VPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, making it more difficult to track your online activity. Use a reputable VPN service, but be aware that VPNs are not foolproof and can still be compromised. .

### Be Mindful of Social Media

Avoid posting real-time updates about your location or activities on social media. Law enforcement can use this information to track you and others. Be cautious about posting photos or videos that could identify other protestors.

### Remove Identifying Information

Consider removing or covering up any identifying information on your clothing or accessories, such as logos or patches. This can help to protect your anonymity.

### Know Your Rights

Familiarize yourself with your rights as a protestor. Know what you can and cannot be legally compelled to do. Contact a lawyer or legal organization for more information. .

## Staying Safe and Secure: A Summary

Protecting your digital security during a protest requires a multi-faceted approach. By taking these precautions, you can significantly reduce your risk of surveillance and protect your privacy. Remember, knowledge is power, and preparation is key.

*   **Minimize Your Digital Footprint:** Limit the amount of personal information you carry with you.
*   **Encrypt Your Communications:** Use end-to-end encryption for all calls and messages.
*   **Protect Your Phone:** Secure your device with a strong passcode and disable biometrics.
*   **Be Aware of Your Surroundings:** Be mindful of potential surveillance tactics.
*   **Know Your Rights:** Understand your legal protections as a protestor.

By taking these steps, you can exercise your right to protest safely and securely in the age of **surveillance**.
