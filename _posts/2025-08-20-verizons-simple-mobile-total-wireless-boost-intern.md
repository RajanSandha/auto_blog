Planning a trip abroad and worried about staying connected? Verizon's Simple Mobile and Total Wireless are making it easier and more affordable to use your phone internationally. Starting August 28th, these prepaid brands are expanding their international features and increasing data allotments, meaning you can travel without the stress of finding local coverage or racking up huge roaming charges.

## Staying Connected While Traveling Just Got Easier

More and more people are traveling internationally, and staying connected is essential. Verizon is responding to this trend by enhancing the international options on its Simple Mobile and Total Wireless plans. This means more data, more countries for calling, and broader roaming coverage, all without necessarily needing a more expensive plan.

Most phone plans already include basic options for Canada and Mexico, but these updates go much further, extending coverage to numerous countries around the globe.

## Simple Mobile Gets a Significant Upgrade

Simple Mobile is boosting its **prepaid plans** with increased high-speed data and expanded international calling. Here’s a breakdown of the changes:

*   **$25 Unlimited Plan:** Now includes 15GB of high-speed data (previously 3GB) and unlimited calling to over 100 countries.
*   **$30 Unlimited Plan:** Boasts 20GB of high-speed data (previously 5GB) and unlimited calling to over 125 countries (up from 100).
*   **$40 Unlimited Plan:** Offers 30GB of high-speed data (previously 15GB) and unlimited calling to over 125 countries (up from 100).
*   **$50 Unlimited World Plan:** Formerly the Truly Unlimited plan, now includes unlimited high-speed data and unlimited calling to over 200 countries (doubled from before).
*   **$60 Unlimited World Plus Plan:** Formerly the Truly Unlimited Plus plan, provides unlimited access to Verizon's fastest 5G Ultra Wideband network (where available), unlimited high-speed data, unlimited calling to over 200 countries (doubled), and international roaming in over 140 countries.

These upgrades make Simple Mobile a much more attractive option for international travelers. The increased data allowances are particularly significant, allowing for more browsing, streaming, and video calls without worrying about running out of data.

## Total Wireless Enhancements for Global Travelers

Total Wireless is also stepping up its game with improved international features on its top-tier plans:

*   **Total 5G Unlimited ($50/month) & Total 5G Unlimited Plus ($60/month):** These plans feature unlimited high-speed data, including 5G Ultra Wideband speeds. As of August 28th, roaming coverage doubles to over 30 countries and international calling extends to 180 countries.

*   **Total Base 5G Unlimited:** This plan remains unchanged with unlimited high-speed data (but no 5G Ultra Wideband), international calling to over 85 countries, texting to over 200 destinations, and roaming in Canada and Mexico.

The expansion of roaming coverage and international calling makes the Total 5G Unlimited and Total 5G Unlimited Plus plans even more compelling for users who frequently travel internationally.

## Actionable Takeaway: Compare Plans and Maximize Your Savings

Before your next international trip, take a close look at your current mobile plan and compare it to the updated Simple Mobile and Total Wireless offerings. You might find that switching plans or providers can save you money and provide a better international experience. Consider your data needs, calling habits, and the countries you plan to visit to make the best choice. Don't forget to read the fine print regarding specific country coverage and roaming limitations.

## Why This Matters: The Future of International Connectivity

Verizon's move to enhance the international features of its prepaid brands reflects a growing demand for seamless global connectivity. As travel becomes more accessible and remote work gains popularity, reliable and affordable international phone plans will become increasingly important. This trend is likely to continue, with other carriers following suit to offer competitive international options.

As tech expert Sarah Miller notes, “Consumers are no longer willing to pay exorbitant roaming fees or rely on unreliable Wi-Fi while traveling. They expect their mobile plans to work seamlessly wherever they go.”
