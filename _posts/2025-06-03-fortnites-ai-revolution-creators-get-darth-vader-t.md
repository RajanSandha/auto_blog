## Fortnite's AI Revolution: Creators Get Darth Vader Tech for Custom NPCs!

Get ready, *Fortnite* creators! Epic Games is leveling up the creative landscape by giving you the tools to build AI-powered NPCs, drawing inspiration from the popular AI Darth Vader integration. This exciting development, unveiled at the State of Unreal show, promises to inject a whole new level of interactivity and personality into your *Fortnite* creations.

### Unleashing the Power of AI in UEFN

Imagine crafting characters with unique personalities, voices, and behaviors. Using the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), you'll soon be able to do just that! This feature allows creators to:

*   Define the AI NPC's characteristics.
*   Customize their voice and delivery.
*   Create engaging conversations with players.

Think of the possibilities! From quirky shopkeepers to challenging quest givers, the only limit is your imagination. This *AI* integration is a game-changer for *Fortnite* content creation.

### A Glimpse into the Future: Mr. Buttons

During a live demo, Epic showcased an AI character named "Mr. Buttons," whose sole purpose was to entice players to press a big red button. This simple yet compelling example demonstrates the potential for creating dynamic and interactive experiences within *Fortnite*. The AI reacted to questions and encouraged rule-breaking, highlighting the depth of interaction possible.

### Learning from the Dark Side: The Darth Vader Experiment

Remember the *AI* Darth Vader NPC that debuted in *Fortnite*? While it had a few hiccups (including a hotfix after some unexpected language!), it proved the potential of *AI*-powered characters. Epic is now building upon that success, empowering creators to build their own unique AI companions.

### More AI Goodies: Epic Developer Assistant

But wait, there's more! Epic is also beta testing the Epic Developer Assistant, an *AI* chatbot designed to help UEFN creators write code in Verse, the UEFN programming language. This tool could significantly streamline the development process, making it easier than ever to bring your visions to life. 

### New Worlds to Explore: Squid Game, Avatar, and More!

Epic isn't just adding *AI*; they're also expanding the creative toolkit with new franchises! Get ready for:

*   *Squid Game* assets (available June 27th).
*   *Avatar: The Last Airbender* assets (coming in 2026).
*   *Star Wars* assets (coming soon!).
*   LEGO experiences (available June 17th).

These additions will give creators even more options for building diverse and engaging *gaming* experiences within *Fortnite*.

### The Future of Fortnite is in Your Hands

With AI-powered NPCs, the Epic Developer Assistant, and a wealth of new assets, the future of *Fortnite* creation is brighter than ever. Get ready to unleash your creativity and build the next generation of unforgettable *gaming* experiences! What kind of AI NPC will you create?
