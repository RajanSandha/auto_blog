# Super Mario Odyssey Team Tackles Donkey Kong Bananza!

Nintendo fans, get ready for a barrel of fun! The development team behind the critically acclaimed *Super Mario Odyssey* is now bringing their platforming prowess to the world of Donkey Kong with the upcoming *Donkey Kong Bananza*. This exciting news has sent ripples of anticipation through the gaming community, raising questions about what this collaboration means for the future of both franchises.

## The Odyssey Team's New Adventure

Ahead of *Donkey Kong Bananza*'s scheduled release on July 17th, Nintendo revealed a significant detail: the very team that crafted the imaginative landscapes and innovative gameplay of *Super Mario Odyssey* is at the helm of this new Donkey Kong title. This revelation is particularly exciting given the considerable time since *Odyssey*'s release and the anticipation surrounding what this talented team has been working on. 

This move showcases Nintendo's commitment to nurturing and retaining talent. By entrusting the Donkey Kong IP to a team with a proven track record of innovation and success, Nintendo is signalling a desire to inject fresh ideas and polish into the franchise. It's a strategic decision that leverages the expertise gained from *Super Mario Odyssey* to potentially redefine the Donkey Kong experience.

## A Legacy of Platforming Excellence

Nintendo boasts a history of cultivating talent within its ranks. Developers who honed their skills on early *Kirby*, *Mario*, and *Zelda* titles have often remained with the company, contributing to subsequent entries and even leading development teams. This continuity has fostered a consistent level of quality across Nintendo's first-party games, allowing them to navigate the ever-changing landscape of the gaming industry with relative stability. *Super Mario Odyssey* itself stands as a testament to this approach, being one of the best-selling games on the Nintendo Switch.

### What Does This Mean for Donkey Kong?

The involvement of the *Super Mario Odyssey* team suggests a possible evolution of the Donkey Kong formula. According to *The Verge*'s Cameron Faulkner, *Donkey Kong Bananza* retains its unique identity but incorporates elements of Mario's 3D platforming DNA. This could translate to more intricate level design, a greater emphasis on exploration, and perhaps even new movement mechanics for Donkey Kong. This marks Donkey Kong's first true 3D platformer since *Donkey Kong 64*, raising the stakes significantly. 

It's exciting to imagine how the team's experience with *Odyssey*'s open-world environments and creative power-ups could translate to the Donkey Kong universe. Could we see sprawling jungle landscapes filled with secrets to uncover? Or perhaps new abilities that allow Donkey Kong to interact with the environment in innovative ways?

## The Future of Mario and Donkey Kong

The announcement inevitably sparks speculation about the future of the Mario franchise. With the *Odyssey* team focused on *Donkey Kong Bananza*, the question arises: when can we expect a new 3D Mario adventure, potentially for the rumored Switch 2? Or is Nintendo's current focus solely on revitalizing the Donkey Kong series for now?

### Speculation and Possibilities

Several possibilities emerge:

*   **A Dual Focus:** Nintendo could be developing both a new 3D Mario game and *Donkey Kong Bananza* simultaneously, with different teams dedicated to each project.
*   **Donkey Kong First:** The success of *Donkey Kong Bananza* could be a determining factor in the timeline for a new Mario game. A positive reception could encourage Nintendo to further invest in the Donkey Kong IP before returning to Mario.
*   **A Shared Engine:** The two games could potentially share a common engine or development tools, allowing for greater efficiency and cross-pollination of ideas.

## Actionable Takeaway: Embrace the Platforming Renaissance

Whether you're a long-time fan of Mario or Donkey Kong (or both!), now is a great time to revisit these iconic franchises. Replaying *Super Mario Odyssey* can give you a sense of the team's design sensibilities and help you anticipate what they might bring to *Donkey Kong Bananza*. And, of course, mark your calendars for July 17th to experience the new Donkey Kong adventure firsthand!
