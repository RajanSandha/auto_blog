## Ali Partovi's Eight-Year Bet: From Coding Tests to Startup Success Stories

In the vibrant ecosystem of Silicon Valley, where familiar names often hog the spotlight, Ali Partovi has quietly exerted a significant influence for years. Despite not being a household name, this Iranian-born Harvard graduate boasts an impressive track record, having been part of the founding team of LinkExchange (acquired by Microsoft for $265 million in 1998) and co-founding iLike (later acquired by MySpace). However, Partovi's most recent endeavor, an eight-year experiment focused on identifying and nurturing promising talent, is now bearing fruit in a big way.

### The Genesis of a Vision

Partovi's vision stemmed from a simple observation: identifying raw talent early on can lead to extraordinary outcomes.
