## Anker Recalls More Power Banks Due to Fire Risk: Is Yours Affected?

Anker, a popular manufacturer of charging accessories, has issued a second recall this month, raising concerns among users of their power banks. This time, five additional models are being recalled due to a potential risk of overheating, melting, smoke, or even fire. If you own an Anker power bank, it's crucial to check if your model is affected.

### Why the Recall? A Potential Battery Issue

According to Anker, the recall is a precautionary measure stemming from a "potential issue" with lithium-ion batteries supplied by one of their vendors. This mirrors the reason behind their earlier recall of the A1263 PowerCore 10000 model. While the company states that the likelihood of malfunction is minimal, they are taking a proactive approach to ensure customer safety.

### Which Anker Power Banks Are Affected?

The following models are part of this latest recall:

*   Anker Power Bank (model A1257 and A1647)
*   Anker MagGo Power Bank (model A1652)
*   Anker Zolo Power Bank (model A1681 and A1689)

**How to Check Your Model:** The model number can be found on the back or side of your Anker power bank. Take a moment to locate it and compare it to the list above.

### What to Do If Your Power Bank Is Recalled

Anker is offering affected customers in the US a choice between a free replacement power bank or a gift card for the Anker website. To claim your replacement or gift card, you'll need to submit a recall claim form on Anker's website. You'll also need to provide a verified product serial number or proof of purchase.

**Actionable Takeaway:** Visit [Anker's recall website](https://www.anker.com/rc2506-form) immediately if you own one of the recalled power banks and submit your claim.

### Safe Disposal Is Critical

Anker emphasizes the importance of safely disposing of recalled power banks at a facility that accepts lithium-ion batteries. Due to the fire risk, these batteries **should not** be thrown away in general trash, recycling bins, or used battery boxes at retail locations. Contact your local waste management authority for information on proper disposal methods.

### A Growing Concern: Reports of Fires and Explosions

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has received 19 reports of fires and explosions related to the earlier A1263 model recall. While it's not yet clear if similar reports exist for these newly recalled power banks, Anker's swift action and global outreach suggest they are taking the matter very seriously. They have also notified global regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with local guidelines.

### The Importance of Battery Safety

This recall highlights the importance of battery safety in portable electronic devices. Lithium-ion batteries, while powerful and widely used, can pose risks if not manufactured and handled properly. Overcharging, physical damage, and exposure to extreme temperatures can all increase the risk of battery failure.

"Battery safety is paramount in today's tech landscape," says Dr. Anya Sharma, a materials science engineer specializing in battery technology. "Manufacturers need to implement rigorous quality control measures throughout the entire production process, from sourcing materials to final assembly. Consumers also play a vital role by following safety guidelines and properly disposing of damaged or recalled products."

### The Broader Impact on Anker's Reputation

This second recall in a single month could potentially damage Anker's reputation for quality and reliability. However, by taking swift and decisive action, offering replacements, and emphasizing safety, Anker is attempting to mitigate the long-term impact. Transparency and clear communication with customers will be crucial in rebuilding trust.
