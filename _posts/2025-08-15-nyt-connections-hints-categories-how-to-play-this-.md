Unlike *Wordle*, *Connections* presents a different kind of challenge, focusing on grouping words rather than guessing a single word. Let's dive into how to play and some strategies to help you conquer this addictive game.

### What is NYT Connections?

*Connections* is a daily word game created by the *New York Times*. The game challenges players to group 16 words into four categories, with each category containing four words that share a common theme or connection. The *Times* credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the game.

You can play *Connections* on your web browser or mobile device. The goal is simple: identify the four sets of related words. But don't be fooled â€“ it can get tricky!

### How to Play Connections

1.  **The Grid:** You're presented with a 4x4 grid of 16 words.
2.  **Find the Connections:** Your mission is to identify four groups of four words that share something in common.
3.  **Make Your Guesses:** Select four words you believe belong together and submit your guess.
4.  **Feedback:** The game will tell you if you're right. If you get all four words in a set correct, they disappear from the board.
5.  **Mistakes Allowed:** You have four attempts to solve the entire puzzle. Each incorrect guess counts as a mistake.
6.  **Color-Coding:** The categories are color-coded by difficulty: Yellow (easiest), Green, Blue, and Purple (hardest).
7.  **Shuffle:** If you're stuck, you can shuffle the board to rearrange the words and potentially spot new connections.

### Strategies and Tips for Success

*   **Look for Obvious Connections:** Start by identifying the most apparent relationships between words.
*   **Consider Multiple Meanings:** Some words have multiple meanings. Think about all the possible interpretations.
*   **Think Outside the Box:** Don't be afraid to get creative and look for less obvious associations.
*   **Use the Shuffle Feature:** Rearranging the board can help you see the words in a new light.
*   **Pay Attention to Color-Coding:** If you're struggling, focus on the easier (yellow and green) categories first.
*   **Eliminate Incorrect Guesses:** If you make a mistake, try to understand why your guess was wrong and eliminate those words from consideration.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Guess:** Sometimes, the best way to learn is by trial and error.
