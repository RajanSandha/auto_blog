## SixSense Raises $8.5M to Revolutionize Chip Manufacturing with AI

Singapore-based **SixSense**, a startup focused on using **AI** to improve semiconductor manufacturing, has secured $8.5 million in Series A funding. This investment, led by Peak XV’s Surge (formerly Sequoia India & SEA), will help SixSense further develop and deploy its **AI**-powered platform that detects and prevents defects in chip production. This is a big deal for the semiconductor industry, which is constantly striving for greater efficiency and higher yields.

### Tackling a Major Challenge in Chip Manufacturing

The core problem SixSense is tackling is the overwhelming amount of data generated during chip manufacturing. From defect images to equipment signals, fabs are flooded with information. However, according to SixSense's co-founders, Akanksha Jagwani (CTO) and Avni Agarwal (CEO), real-time intelligence is often lacking. Engineers are left to manually sift through data, identify patterns, and trace the root causes of defects – a process that's time-consuming, subjective, and doesn't scale well. SixSense's **AI** platform aims to automate and streamline this process, providing engineers with actionable insights in real time.

### From Aviation to Semiconductors: Finding the Right Niche

Before focusing on semiconductors, the founders explored other industries like aviation and automotive. However, they recognized a significant opportunity to modernize quality control in the semiconductor industry. They discovered that despite the industry's focus on precision, inspection processes were often manual and fragmented. This realization led them to develop an **AI**-driven solution specifically tailored to the needs of semiconductor manufacturers.

### How SixSense's Platform Works

SixSense's platform provides early warnings to engineers, allowing them to address potential issues before they escalate. Its key capabilities include:

*   **Defect Detection:** Identifying defects in real-time.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Pinpointing the causes of defects.
*   **Failure Prediction:** Predicting potential failures before they occur.

One of the key advantages of the platform is its ease of use. It's designed for process engineers, not just data scientists. Engineers can fine-tune models using their own data and deploy them quickly, without needing to write code. This empowers them to take control of the quality control process and make data-driven decisions.

### The Competitive Landscape

SixSense faces competition from various players, including:

*   In-house engineering teams using tools like Cognex and Halcon.
*   Inspection equipment makers integrating **AI** into their systems.
*   Startups like Landing.ai and Robovision.

However, SixSense differentiates itself with its focus on providing a user-friendly, **AI**-native platform that can be easily integrated into existing manufacturing processes.

### Early Success and Expansion Plans

SixSense's **AI** platform is already being used by major semiconductor manufacturers like GlobalFoundries and JCET. Customers have reported significant improvements, including:

*   Up to 30% faster production cycles.
*   A 1-2% boost in yield.
*   A 90% reduction in manual inspection work.

The company is currently working with fabs in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Israel, and is now expanding into the U.S.

### Geopolitical Tensions and the Rise of New Manufacturing Hubs

Geopolitical tensions are driving new manufacturing investments in regions like Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, India, and the U.S. This trend creates a favorable environment for SixSense, as these new facilities are more open to adopting **AI**-native approaches.

### Actionable Takeaway

For semiconductor manufacturers, consider evaluating **AI**-powered solutions like SixSense to improve quality control and optimize production yields. Don't rely solely on manual inspection processes, which are time-consuming and prone to errors. Embracing **AI** can lead to significant cost savings and efficiency gains.

### Expert Commentary (Simulated)

"The semiconductor industry is ripe for disruption," says Dr. Anya Sharma, an **AI** expert at Stanford University. "SixSense's approach of empowering process engineers with **AI** tools is a game-changer. It allows them to make data-driven decisions and proactively address potential issues, leading to significant improvements in manufacturing efficiency."
