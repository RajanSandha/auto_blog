## Roku Investigates Washed-Out Colors in HDR Streams: Is Your TV Affected?

Are you experiencing dull, washed-out colors when streaming HDR content on your Roku TV? You're not alone. Roku is currently investigating widespread user reports of this issue, which seems to be affecting various streaming apps, not just Disney Plus as initially suspected. Let's dive into the details of this developing situation.

### The Problem: Desaturated Colors Across Multiple Streaming Services

The issue first surfaced on Roku's issue tracking board, with users reporting that HDR content on Disney Plus appeared washed out. A Roku community moderator, RokuEmmanuel-D, acknowledged the problem in a recent update, stating that the company is actively investigating the reports of desaturated colors after a recent software update. They've requested users to provide specific examples, TV models, and software versions to help pinpoint the root cause.

Initially, reports focused on Disney Plus and TCL TVs. However, the problem appears to be more widespread. Users are now reporting similar issues with other popular streaming services such as Netflix, YouTube TV, Apple TV Plus, and Amazon Prime Video. This suggests that the issue isn't isolated to a specific app but is likely related to a recent Roku software update affecting HDR processing.

### User Experiences: From Disney Plus to Beyond

One user shared before-and-after images of the Disney Plus show *Andor*, demonstrating the dramatic difference in color vibrancy. Normally vibrant colors have been replaced with a grayish, desaturated pall. This visual evidence highlights the severity of the problem and the impact it has on the viewing experience.

While initial reports centered around TCL TVs, users with Hisense-branded Roku TVs are also experiencing the same problem. Interestingly, some users have reported that HDR content works fine when streamed through HDMI from devices like a PS5 or a 4K Blu-Ray player. This suggests that the issue is specific to Roku's streaming functionality and not a broader TV firmware problem.

### Root Cause: A Recent Roku Software Update?

The prevailing theory is that a recent Roku software update is the culprit. Many users experiencing the issue report being on Roku software version 14.5. While Roku hasn't officially confirmed the cause, the timing of the reports suggests a strong correlation between the update and the emergence of the washed-out color issue.

### Is Your TV Too Old for HDR?

It's important to note that washed-out colors can sometimes occur when watching HDR content on TVs that aren't bright enough to properly display HDR. However, the current reports describe something different â€“ a significant desaturation of colors, almost to the point of black and white, even on TVs that previously displayed HDR content correctly.

### Reddit Reports and Community Discussions

The issue isn't confined to the Roku issue tracking board. Reddit threads are also filled with users reporting similar problems, describing grayish or black-and-white picture quality that doesn't affect the streaming app menus. This further emphasizes the widespread nature of the problem and the frustration it's causing among Roku users.

### What You Can Do:

If you're experiencing washed-out colors on your Roku TV, here are a few steps you can take:

*   **Check Your Roku Software Version:** Navigate to Settings > System > About to check your current software version. If you're on version 14.5, it's likely related to the issue.
*   **Report the Issue to Roku:** Contribute to the Roku issue tracking board with details about your TV model, software version, and the apps affected. This helps Roku gather information and identify the root cause.
*   **Try Different HDMI Inputs:** As a temporary workaround, try using a different HDMI input on your TV.
*   **Adjust Picture Settings:** Experiment with your TV's picture settings. While it might not completely resolve the issue, it could improve the color balance.
*   **Disable HDR (Temporary Workaround):** As a last resort, you can temporarily disable HDR in your Roku settings. This will revert the content to standard dynamic range (SDR), which should eliminate the washed-out colors. However, you'll lose the benefits of HDR until the issue is resolved.
*   **Monitor Roku's Issue Tracking Board:** Keep an eye on the Roku issue tracking board for updates and potential solutions.

### Roku's Response and What to Expect

Roku hasn't yet issued an official statement beyond acknowledging the issue on its issue tracking board. However, the company is actively investigating the reports and gathering information from users. It's likely that Roku will release a software update to address the problem once the root cause is identified.

### Conclusion: Awaiting a Fix

The washed-out color issue is a frustrating problem for Roku users, impacting the viewing experience across various streaming services. While Roku is investigating the issue, affected users can take steps to report the problem and try temporary workarounds. Hopefully, a software update will soon be released to restore the vibrant colors that Roku users expect. Stay tuned for updates as this situation develops.
