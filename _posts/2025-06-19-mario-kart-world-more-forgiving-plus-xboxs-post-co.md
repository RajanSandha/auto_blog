## Mario Kart World: Why It's Less Punishing and More Fun

Hey there, fellow gamers! Ready for your weekly dose of video game news and insights? This week, we're diving into why *Mario Kart World* is a breath of fresh air, plus catching up on the latest industry buzz, including Xbox's potential shift away from traditional consoles.

### Mario Kart World: A More Forgiving Experience

I've been glued to my Switch 2 since it launched on June 5th, and honestly, *Mario Kart World* has been consuming most of my playtime. It's the *couch co-op* game I've been craving, and it delivers in spades!

*Mario Kart World* is vibrant, endlessly replayable, and introduces a higher skill ceiling with mechanics like wall riding and rail grinds. These additions add a new layer of complexity for competitive players, pushing them to find every possible shortcut and strategic advantage. While *Mario Kart* might not be a serious esport, that doesn't stop players from getting incredibly skilled.

But here's the thing I really want to highlight: *Mario Kart World* is noticeably less frustrating than *Mario Kart 8*. And I think that's a **major** win.

### Less Frustration, More Flow

Let's be real, getting bombarded with shells and slipping on banana peels in *Mario Kart 8* could be rage-inducing. But in *Mario Kart World*, those moments feel far less jarring. Recovery is quicker, and getting back into the race after a red shell attack is much smoother.

Is it shorter stun times? Faster post-collision acceleration? Maybe a combination of both? Whatever the reason, I'm loving it. *Mario Kart World* feels more flow-friendly and accessible. These subtle tweaks minimize those annoying moments where you're bombarded with items and sent spiraling.

The only truly disruptive item is the lightning bolt, but hey, at least it affects everyone equally!

### A Visual Treat and More

Beyond the improved gameplay, *Mario Kart World* is just gorgeous. The tracks, like Starview Peak and Rainbow Road, are visually stunning. The character roster is packed with adorable new faces, and motorcycles feel more stable than ever before. Plus, the 24-player Knockout Tour is a blast and a great way to test your skills.

With the potential for a barrage of items coming your way, it's clear Nintendo focused on making recovery more seamless, and it makes a huge difference.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go practice my wall riding!

## The News You Need to Know

Alright, let's shift gears and catch up on some of the biggest headlines in the gaming world this week:

### Xbox Eyes a Post-Console Future

Xbox president Sarah Bond revealed that their next generation of hardware will continue to be powered by AMD, similar to the Xbox Series X/S and the upcoming  handhelds.

This announcement hints at a broader strategy: Xbox seems to be positioning itself as a platform-agnostic software provider, embracing PC and handheld gaming, and offering a unified storefront across devices. The next Xbox might resemble a PC under your TV rather than a traditional, closed-system console.

Could this be the future of gaming? A more open, decentralized ecosystem where your games follow you, regardless of the device? It's a bold vision, and it will be interesting to see how it unfolds.

### SAG-AFTRA Strike Ends: A Win for Video Game Performers

After nearly a year of negotiations, SAG-AFTRA has suspended its strike against 10 major video game studios. This is a significant victory for performers, as the new deal includes wage increases for over 24% of performers and crucial protections regarding the use of AI and digital replicas.

This agreement sets a precedent for the industry and highlights the importance of fair compensation and ethical AI practices in video game development.

### Bungie Delays *Marathon*: A Necessary Pause?

Bungie has indefinitely delayed *Marathon*, citing the need for a significant overhaul. This decision follows a series of challenges for the studio, including layoffs, accusations of stolen artwork, and reports of a toxic work environment.

Whether *Marathon* truly needs a revamp or Bungie simply needs time to regroup, a delay seems like the right call. Hopefully, this pause will allow them to address the issues and deliver a game that lives up to its potential.

### *Borderlands 4* Price Controversy: Calm Down, Everyone!

Amidst some confusion, it's been confirmed that *Borderlands 4* will *not* cost $80. It will be priced at $70, which is still a significant investment, but less alarming than the initial reports.

### Bloober Team Takes the Reins of *Silent Hill*

Bloober Team, known for their psychological horror expertise, is officially remaking the original *Silent Hill* for Konami. This project follows their successful reimagining of *Silent Hill 2*, which received widespread acclaim. While there's no release date yet, this remake is joining a growing lineup of *Silent Hill* projects, including *Silent Hill Townfall*, *Silent Hill: Ascension*, and *Silent Hill f*.
