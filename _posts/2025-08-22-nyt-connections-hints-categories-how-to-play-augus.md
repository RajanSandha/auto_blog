## What is NYT Connections?

*Connections* is a word association game where you must group 16 seemingly unrelated words into four categories of four. Created by the *NYT*'s associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu, the game is available on the web and mobile devices.

The goal is to identify the hidden links between the words and successfully categorize them. It sounds simple, but the game's increasing difficulty and clever wordplay can make it a real brain-teaser.

Here’s how it works:

*   **The Grid:** You're presented with a 4x4 grid of 16 words.
*   **Find the Connections:** Your task is to find the common thread that links four words together.
*   **Make Your Guesses:** Select four words you believe belong to the same category and submit your guess.
*   **Four Attempts:** You have a maximum of four attempts to solve the entire puzzle. Incorrect guesses count as mistakes.
*   **Color-Coded Categories:** Each category has a difficulty level, represented by a color: Yellow (easiest), Green, Blue, and Purple (hardest).

Players can also shuffle the board to rearrange the words and potentially reveal hidden connections.

## Today's Connections Hints (August 22, 2025)

Before we reveal the categories, let's give you some hints to nudge you in the right direction:

*   **Yellow:** Think about leadership roles.
*   **Green:** These folks are known for their performances on the big screen.
*   **Blue:** Place your bets!
*   **Purple:** Consider popular movies from the 90s.

### Strategy Tip:

Start with the categories you find easiest. Identifying the yellow category first can give you a foothold and make it easier to spot the remaining connections. Also, pay attention to words that seem to have multiple possible connections – they might be a red herring!
