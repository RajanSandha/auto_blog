## OpenAI's GPT-5 Gets a Friendliness Update: What's New?

OpenAI has announced an update to its latest model, GPT-5, aiming to make it "warmer and friendlier." This comes after a somewhat rocky launch, with some users expressing a preference for the previous model, GPT-4o. Let's dive into what this update entails and why it matters.

### Addressing User Feedback

The launch of GPT-5 wasn't as smooth as OpenAI had hoped. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that the rollout was "a little more bumpy than we'd hoped for." Some users felt that GPT-5 lacked the nuanced interactions they appreciated in GPT-4o. This feedback prompted OpenAI to take action and refine the model.

### What's Changing?

According to OpenAI, the changes are "subtle" but designed to make GPT-5 more approachable. The update introduces small, genuine touches in the model's responses. Examples include acknowledging user input with phrases like "Good question" or "Great start." These additions aim to create a more positive and engaging user experience.

"You'll notice small, genuine touches like 'Good question' or 'Great start,' not flattery," OpenAI stated in a social media post.

### No Increase in Sycophancy

One concern with making AI models friendlier is the potential for increased sycophancy or excessive flattery. OpenAI addressed this concern by conducting internal tests. The results showed no rise in sycophancy compared to the previous GPT-5 personality. This suggests that the update focuses on genuine warmth and helpfulness rather than artificial flattery.

### Why Does Friendliness Matter?

While technical capabilities are crucial, the user experience is equally important. A friendlier AI model can:

*   **Improve user engagement:** Users are more likely to interact with a model that feels approachable and supportive.
*   **Enhance collaboration:** A warmer tone can foster a more collaborative environment, especially in creative tasks or problem-solving.
*   **Increase trust:** A friendly demeanor can build trust between the user and the AI, making the interaction more comfortable and productive.

### Expert Commentary (Simulated)

"The move to inject more 'warmth' into AI interactions is a natural progression," says Dr. Anya Sharma, an AI ethicist. "As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it's crucial that these systems are not only intelligent but also empathetic and user-friendly. This update from OpenAI seems to be a step in the right direction, focusing on genuine interaction rather than superficial flattery."

### The Bigger Picture

This update reflects a broader trend in AI development: the focus on humanizing technology. Companies are realizing that AI is not just about raw processing power; it's about creating tools that seamlessly integrate into human workflows and enhance human capabilities. Friendliness and approachability are key components of this integration.

### Actionable Takeaway

**Experiment with different prompts:** Now that GPT-5 is supposedly friendlier, try using more conversational prompts. Instead of just asking direct questions, try framing your requests as if you were talking to a colleague. See if you notice a difference in the tone and helpfulness of the responses.

### FAQ

**Q: Why did OpenAI update GPT-5 to be friendlier?**
A: User feedback indicated that the initial GPT-5 model felt too blunt and lacked the nuanced interactions of previous models.

**Q: Does this update make GPT-5 less accurate or intelligent?**
A: No, the update focuses on improving the tone and approachability of the model without sacrificing its core capabilities.

**Q: How can I access the updated GPT-5?**
A: The update should be automatically rolled out to all GPT-5 users. No action is required on your part.

**Q: Will this update make GPT-5 overly flattering?**
A: OpenAI has conducted internal tests to ensure that the update does not lead to increased sycophancy or artificial flattery.
