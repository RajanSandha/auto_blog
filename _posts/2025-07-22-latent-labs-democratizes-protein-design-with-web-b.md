## Latent Labs Democratizes Protein Design with Web-Based AI Model

Latent Labs is shaking up the world of protein design with its new web-based AI model, LatentX. After securing $50 million in funding just six months ago, the company is now making its cutting-edge technology accessible to a wider audience. This move could revolutionize how we develop new medicines and materials.

### What is LatentX?

LatentX is a foundational biology model that allows users to design novel proteins directly in their web browser using natural language. Think of it as an AI-powered protein design studio. This is a game-changer because it simplifies the complex process of protein engineering.

### State-of-the-Art Performance

According to Latent Labs CEO and founder Simon Kohl, LatentX has achieved "state-of-the-art" performance on various metrics. Kohl previously co-led DeepMind's AlphaFold protein design team, so he knows a thing or two about AI and protein folding. In the AI world, “state-of-the-art,” or SOTA, means the best performance achieved so far on a specific task. Latent Labs claims that when tested in a physical lab, the proteins designed by their model proved highly viable.

### Beyond Nature: Designing New Proteins

What sets LatentX apart is its ability to create entirely new protein designs, not just predict existing ones. It can generate novel molecules like nanobodies and antibodies with precise atomic structures. This opens up exciting possibilities for developing new therapeutics and materials with unprecedented properties.

### LatentX vs. AlphaFold: What's the Difference?

Many people are familiar with DeepMind's AlphaFold, which has revolutionized protein structure prediction. However, LatentX takes it a step further. While AlphaFold predicts the structure of existing proteins, LatentX allows users to *design* entirely new ones. As Kohl explains, "AlphaFold is a model for protein structure prediction… it allows you to visualize existing structures, but it doesn’t let you generate new proteins."

### Democratizing Protein Design

Latent Labs' mission is to democratize protein design. By offering a web-based AI model, they are making this powerful technology accessible to academic institutions, biotech startups, and pharmaceutical companies, regardless of their resources.

### A Different Business Model

Unlike AI-driven drug discovery companies like Xaira, Recursion, or Isomorphic Labs (a DeepMind spinout), which focus on developing their own proprietary medicines, Latent Labs licenses its model to external organizations. This allows other companies to leverage the power of LatentX for their own research and development efforts.

Kohl emphasizes that "Not every company is in a position to build their own AI models, to have their own AI infrastructure, and to have their own AI teams." Latent Labs provides a solution for these organizations.

### Free Access and Future Plans

Currently, LatentX is available for free. However, Latent Labs plans to introduce advanced features and capabilities in the future, which will likely be offered on a subscription basis.

### The Future of Protein Design

Latent Labs is part of a growing trend of companies providing open-sourced AI foundational models for drug discovery, including Chai Discovery and EvolutionaryScale. With the backing of prominent investors like Radical Ventures, Sofinnova Partners, Google’s Chief Scientist Jeff Dean, Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei, and Eleven Labs CEO Mati Staniszewski, Latent Labs is well-positioned to lead the charge in democratizing protein design and accelerating innovation in biotechnology.
