## Parry This! Two New Games Embrace the Art of Deflection

Gamers, sharpen your reflexes! It's parry season, and two exciting new titles are putting this classic defensive mechanic front and center. Whether you're a fan of pulse-pounding first-person shooters or strategic turn-based RPGs, *Doom: The Dark Ages* and *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* offer fresh and compelling ways to experience the satisfaction of a perfectly timed parry. These games, though vastly different in genre and gameplay, both understand the visceral appeal of turning an enemy's attack against them.

Let's dive into how these games are implementing this exciting mechanic.

## *Doom: The Dark Ages*: Shield Up and Get Ready to Parry!

*Doom: The Dark Ages* promises to be a brutal and visceral experience, and the introduction of a massive shield for the Doom Slayer only amplifies that. This isn't just a passive defense; it's a tool for aggressive counter-attack. The shield can block projectiles and enemy attacks, but the real fun begins with the parry.

To help players master this crucial technique, *Doom: The Dark Ages* cleverly highlights parryable attacks with a bright neon green. This visual cue ensures that even amidst the chaotic ballet of bullets and demonic hordes, you'll be able to identify opportunities to deflect incoming danger. When a green projectile hurtles your way, or an enemy winds up for a green-tinged attack, hitting the parry button at the precise moment unleashes a satisfying counter.

The result? A powerful reverberation from your shield, a brief moment of slow-motion that lets you savor the timing, and a critical opening to unleash your own devastating attack. A successful parry in *Doom: The Dark Ages* isn't just about avoiding damage; it's about creating an opportunity to obliterate your foes with a well-placed punch or a barrage from your favorite monstrous weapon. The game emphasizes the importance of the parry system to make you more effective on the battlefield.

### The Importance of Observation

The key to mastering the parry in *Doom: The Dark Ages* is keen observation. As you navigate the intense battles, constantly be on the lookout for that telltale green glint. Recognizing the visual cue and reacting swiftly will be the difference between becoming demon fodder and becoming an unstoppable force of nature.

## *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*: A Tactical Parry in a World of Peril

While *Doom: The Dark Ages* delivers a visceral, reflex-based parry experience, *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* takes a more strategic approach. As a turn-based fantasy RPG, the game demands careful planning and precise execution, and the parry mechanic is no exception.

Unfortunately, the details surrounding *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*'s parry system are limited in the original source material. However, given the game's genre, we can infer that the parry likely involves strategic timing and positioning within the turn-based combat system. It's possible that specific character builds or abilities will enhance parry effectiveness, adding another layer of depth to the tactical gameplay.

### Speculating on the Mechanics

It's reasonable to assume that *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*'s parry system will require players to anticipate enemy attacks and choose the appropriate defensive action. This might involve selecting a specific parry skill, positioning a character to intercept an attack, or timing the parry input to coincide with the enemy's strike. The success of the parry could then depend on factors such as character stats, enemy attack power, and even a degree of random chance.

## Parry to Victory!

Whether you prefer the adrenaline-pumping action of *Doom: The Dark Ages* or the strategic depth of *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*, both games offer a compelling reason to embrace the art of the parry. This classic mechanic, when implemented well, adds a layer of skill and engagement to combat, rewarding players for their timing, observation, and tactical acumen. So, get ready to sharpen your reflexes, study your enemies, and prepare to turn their attacks against them. It's parry season, and the thrill of a perfectly timed deflection awaits!
