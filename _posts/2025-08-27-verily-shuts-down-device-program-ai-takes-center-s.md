Alphabet's life sciences division, Verily, is making some big changes. They're closing down their medical device program and shifting their focus towards artificial intelligence (AI) and data infrastructure. This move signals a larger trend within Alphabet to prioritize AI investments while streamlining other areas.

## Verily's Pivot: From Devices to Data

According to a staff memo reported by Business Insider, Verily CEO Stephen Gillett announced the "difficult decision" to end the device program. Gillett acknowledged the program's past success in creating innovative medical devices but emphasized that the company's future direction requires a strategic shift.

"Over the years, Verily has built a legacy in developing world-class, innovative medical devices," Gillett wrote, adding that the "path forward requires difficult decisions" as Verily refocuses on AI and data infrastructure. This means resources, including personnel, are being reallocated to support AI-related initiatives.

## Alphabet's AI Push and Cost-Cutting Measures

Verily's decision aligns with Alphabet's broader strategy of aggressively investing in AI. This investment comes alongside cost-cutting measures across the company. Recent layoffs have impacted various divisions, including HR and cloud units in February. There were also voluntary exit programs offered to over 25,000 employees within the Platforms & Devices group in the spring.

In January 2023, Alphabet implemented a significant layoff, reducing its workforce by 6% â€“ a total of 12,000 jobs. This move was largely driven by anticipation of a potential economic slowdown.

## The Generative AI Boom: A Catalyst for Change

The rise of generative AI has undoubtedly influenced Alphabet's strategic shift. The launch of ChatGPT in January 2023 marked a turning point. It rapidly became the fastest-growing consumer software application, amassing over 100 million users in just two months. This explosive growth ignited the generative AI boom, which is now a major driving force behind the tech industry's priorities.

## What Does This Mean for the Future of Verily and Alphabet?

This strategic shift suggests that Alphabet sees AI, and particularly generative AI, as the most promising area for future growth and innovation. By consolidating resources and focusing on AI and data infrastructure, they aim to position themselves as leaders in this rapidly evolving field.

While the closure of the device program may be disappointing to some, it reflects a pragmatic approach to resource allocation. Companies must adapt to changing market dynamics and prioritize investments in areas with the greatest potential for return. For Alphabet, that area is clearly AI.
