### What Makes Strands Unique?

Unlike traditional word searches, Strands lets you connect letters in any direction â€“ up, down, left, right, or diagonally. The words can even change direction mid-word, creating interesting shapes and patterns. The goal? Find all the words related to a specific theme, plus the all-important "spangram" that sums up the theme and stretches across the entire grid.

Strands differentiates itself from other popular word games like Wordle and Connections by offering more opaque hints and removing any word list. This design choice creates a brain-teasing game that can take a little longer to play.
