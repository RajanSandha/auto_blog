## Subnautica 2 Drama: Devs Sue Publisher Over Release Sabotage?

It's a turbulent time in the gaming world as the creators of the highly anticipated *Subnautica 2* are embroiled in a legal battle with their publisher, Krafton. The lawsuit alleges that Krafton deliberately sabotaged the game's early access release to avoid paying a substantial earnout bonus. Let's dive into the details of this developing story.

### What's the Core of the Dispute?

The heart of the issue lies in a disagreement between Krafton and three former executives at Unknown Worlds, the developer behind *Subnautica 2*. These executives, Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire, were terminated earlier this year and have now filed a lawsuit accusing Krafton of intentionally damaging the game's release prospects. The motivation? Allegedly, to sidestep a promised $250 million earnout bonus.

### The Alleged Sabotage

The lawsuit claims that Krafton's actions have already significantly harmed the anticipation and potential success of *Subnautica 2*. The earnout was contingent on Unknown Worlds achieving specific revenue goals by the end of 2025. With *Subnautica 2* slated for early access in late 2025, it was poised to be a major revenue driver.

According to the lawsuit, Krafton was aware that *Subnautica 2* was on track to meet or exceed these revenue targets and began taking steps to prevent the payout. The original *Subnautica*, a critically acclaimed underwater survival adventure, was a massive success. Its sequel has become one of the most wishlisted games on Steam, further raising expectations.

### A Change in Attitude?

The lawsuit details a meeting where Krafton's US and Korean employees discussed the marketing strategy for *Subnautica 2*. After this meeting, Krafton's US employees, who worked closely with the *Subnautica 2* team, allegedly reported a shift in Krafton's attitude toward the game.

"Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game," the lawsuit states.

### More Allegations

The lawsuit further alleges that Krafton's US employees revealed to the Unknown Worlds founders that Krafton's legal team was actively searching for loopholes to terminate the founders if they proceeded with the planned release. This paints a picture of a publisher actively working against its developer.

### The Original Agreement

The lawsuit also sheds light on the original acquisition deal in 2021, where Krafton purchased Unknown Worlds. A key part of the agreement was that the founders would retain control over the company and the release schedule of *Subnautica 2*. Krafton, according to the lawsuit, was not permitted to impede the game's development or fire the founders without just cause.

### Obstructive Actions

The lawsuit claims that Krafton failed to fulfill its development responsibilities for *Subnautica 2*, including withdrawing marketing and localization support. One of Krafton's El Segundo publishing employees allegedly informed Gill that Krafton Headquarters had instructed all Krafton teams to cease all creative tasks related to *Subnautica 2*.

### The $250 Million Question

The core allegation is that Krafton took these obstructive actions specifically to delay the game and avoid the $250 million payout. At a meeting between Krafton CEO Changhan Kim and Charlie Cleveland, Kim allegedly stated that releasing the game on the planned timeline could be financially disastrous and embarrassing for Krafton. Krafton has declined to comment on the matter.

### Recent Developments

Following the initial reports of the alleged delay tactics, *Bloomberg* reported that Krafton had agreed to extend the timeline for the earnout to accommodate *Subnautica 2*'s later release. Previously, the company maintained that the delay was solely to polish the game. An internal document outlining planned content for the game’s early access launch was leaked on Reddit, showing that some material had to be changed or removed to meet the release date.

Krafton acknowledged the authenticity of these documents, stating that transparent communication was necessary, possibly to support its argument that *Subnautica 2* was not ready for its early access release.

### Actionable Takeaway: Stay Informed

This situation highlights the complexities and potential conflicts that can arise between game developers and publishers. Gamers should follow this story closely, as it could impact the future of *Subnautica 2* and the broader gaming industry. Keep an eye on reputable gaming news sources for updates.
