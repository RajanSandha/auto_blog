## Nintendo Switch Update Hints at Exciting Features for the Anticipated Switch 2

Nintendo has just rolled out a significant update (V20.0.0) for the original Nintendo Switch, and while it brings some welcome additions to the existing console, it's hard to ignore the subtle hints pointing towards the upcoming Switch 2. This update seems to be laying the groundwork for the new console, introducing features that will seamlessly integrate with the next generation of Nintendo gaming.

## New Features Pave the Way for Switch 2

The update introduces several key features that suggest a focus on game sharing, data transfer, and account management, all of which are expected to play a vital role in the Switch 2 ecosystem. Let's dive into the details:

### Virtual Game Cards: A Digital Lending Library

One of the most intriguing additions is the **Virtual Game Card** system. This feature allows you to collect your digital software and DLC into virtual cards, which can then be "loaded" and "ejected" between different systems. Think of it as a digital lending library within your Nintendo Account family group.

Imagine lending a game to a family member. With Virtual Game Cards, you can grant them access to the game, and even revoke that access while they're playing (if they're online, of course!). If they happen to be offline, you'll need to wait until the end of the two-week lending period for the game to automatically return to your library. This provides a controlled and convenient way to share your digital game collection.

Nintendo's comprehensive [Virtual Game Card Guide](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891) provides detailed instructions on how to use this new system, including limitations such as the ability to connect each Switch to only one other Switch at a time. The guide also explains how to manage your game cards from the web and how to hide (or unhide) specific cards.

### GameShare: Sharing the Fun (Eventually)

The update also mentions a **GameShare** feature, but with a catch. While the feature is present in the update, it's not fully functional on the original Switch. Sharing can only be initiated from a Switch 2 system over local wireless connections. This strongly suggests that GameShare is designed primarily for the Switch 2, allowing users to easily share games with friends and family nearby.

### Online License Settings: Flexibility for Digital Gamers

For those who want to play their digital games across more than two systems or without the restrictions of Virtual Game Cards, Nintendo has introduced **Online License Settings**. When enabled, this feature allows you to play any of your digitally purchased games and DLC as long as you're connected to the internet, bypassing the need for virtual game cards. This provides greater flexibility for accessing your digital library on multiple devices.

### Streamlined System Transfer: Preparing for the Upgrade

Perhaps the most telling feature in this update is the new option for **System Transfer to Nintendo Switch 2**, found under the System menu in System Settings. This feature offers two methods for transferring your data to the new console:

*   **Local System-to-System Transfer:** Once you have your Switch 2, you can perform a direct transfer of your data from your old Switch.
*   **Cloud Transfer:** This option allows you to upload your system transfer data to the cloud, where it will be stored and ready to download to a Switch 2, even without access to your old system. This is particularly useful if you're planning to sell or give away your original Switch.

However, there are a few caveats to the cloud transfer method. Uploading your data to the cloud will factory reset your Switch 1, so it's best to wait until you have your Switch 2 before proceeding. Additionally, the data will only be stored in the cloud for one year if not downloaded. It's also important to note that if you cancel a Switch 2 cloud transfer and want to bring your data back to a Switch 1, you'll need to use the same type of Switch 1 (e.g., if you started on a Switch OLED, you'll only be able to reload your data on another Switch OLED).

## What Does This Mean for the Switch 2?

This update strongly suggests that Nintendo is actively preparing for the launch of the Switch 2. The new features, particularly the system transfer options and the GameShare functionality, indicate a focus on seamless transitions and enhanced sharing capabilities for the new console. 

While the specific release date and features of the Switch 2 remain officially unconfirmed, this update provides valuable insights into Nintendo's vision for the future of its gaming ecosystem. The emphasis on digital game sharing, cloud saves, and streamlined data transfer points towards a more connected and user-friendly experience on the upcoming console.

## Conclusion

The V20.0.0 update for the Nintendo Switch is more than just a routine patch. It's a carefully orchestrated step towards the future, hinting at the exciting possibilities that await with the Switch 2. While we eagerly await more official announcements, this update offers a tantalizing glimpse into the next generation of Nintendo gaming. Keep your Switch updated, and get ready to experience the evolution of Nintendo's beloved console!
