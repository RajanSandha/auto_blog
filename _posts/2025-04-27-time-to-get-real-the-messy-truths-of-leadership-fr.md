## Time to Get Real: The Messy Truths of Leadership from The RealReal Founder Julie Wainwright

Julie Wainwright, the force behind The RealReal, has achieved a remarkable feat: taking not one, but *two* companies public. This accomplishment alone places her in an elite tier of entrepreneurs. But instead of simply basking in the glow of success, Wainwright is offering something far more valuable in her new memoir, *Time to Get Real*: a candid and unflinching look at the often-turbulent realities of leadership. This isn't a victory lap; it's a deep dive into the messy, challenging, and ultimately human experience of building and scaling a business.
