## OpenAI Responds to User Demand: Older ChatGPT Models May Return

OpenAI's recent launch of **GPT-5**, intended to be the all-encompassing **generative AI model** for their **ChatGPT** platform, hasn't been met with universal acclaim. In fact, a significant portion of users are clamoring for the return of older models like GPT-4o. Let's dive into why, and what OpenAI is planning to do about it.

### The GPT-5 Rollout: A Bumpy Start

According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the rollout of **GPT-5** hasn't been as smooth as anticipated. During a recent Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), Altman addressed concerns about the new model, acknowledging user preferences for older versions.

"We hear you all on 4o," Altman stated, indicating that OpenAI is taking user feedback seriously. The company is now considering offering **ChatGPT Plus** subscribers the option to continue using older models, including the popular 4o.

### Why the Love for Older Models?

So, what's driving this nostalgia for older **ChatGPT** versions? Many users feel that models like GPT-4o offer a more conversational and friendly experience. Some have even described **GPT-5** as "short" and "cold" in comparison. Users have voiced that the older models handled writing and other tasks more effectively, aligning better with their needs.

One user's colorful comment, "GPT-5 is wearing the skin of my dead friend," perfectly encapsulates the sentiment of those who miss the nuances of previous iterations.

### OpenAI's Response and Future Plans

Altman assured users that OpenAI is monitoring usage to determine how long to support 4o for Plus subscribers. This suggests that the availability of older models may depend on the level of demand.

Furthermore, Altman admitted that the program responsible for routing prompts to the appropriate processing model within **GPT-5** (either a faster, lighter model or a more intensive reasoning model) experienced issues shortly after launch. This technical hiccup likely contributed to the initial negative reactions.

### The Importance of User Feedback in AI Development

This situation highlights the critical role of user feedback in the development of **artificial intelligence**. While OpenAI aims to create increasingly powerful and versatile models, it's essential to consider user preferences and ensure that new iterations don't sacrifice qualities that users value. 

This also underscores the iterative nature of AI development. What might seem like a definitive upgrade on paper can sometimes fall short in practice, prompting developers to revisit and refine their approach.

### Actionable Takeaway: Experiment and Provide Feedback

If you're a **ChatGPT Plus** user, take advantage of the opportunity to experiment with both **GPT-5** and older models (if and when they become available). Provide detailed feedback to OpenAI about your experiences. Your input can help shape the future of **generative AI** and ensure that the models meet your specific needs.

### Expert Commentary (Simulated)

"The situation with OpenAI and its users highlights a crucial challenge in AI development: balancing technical advancement with user experience," says Dr. Anya Sharma, a leading AI researcher. "While new models may offer improved performance on certain benchmarks, it's equally important to consider factors like usability, personality, and overall user satisfaction. This incident underscores the need for a more human-centered approach to AI development."
