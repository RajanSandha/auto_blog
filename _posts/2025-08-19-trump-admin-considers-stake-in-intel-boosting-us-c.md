## Trump Admin Considers Stake in Intel: Boosting US Chip Manufacturing

Could the US government soon be a part-owner of Intel? Recent reports suggest the Trump administration is exploring the possibility of acquiring a stake in the semiconductor giant. This move could significantly impact Intel's future and the broader landscape of US chip manufacturing.

### Why is the Government Considering This?

Intel, a key player in the global semiconductor industry, has faced challenges recently. These include:

*   **Struggles in delivering results:** The company hasn't been performing as well as shareholders expect.
*   **Project delays:** Intel's plans to build a semiconductor facility in Ohio have encountered setbacks.
*   **Workforce cuts:** Intel has announced plans to reduce its workforce and scale back on some building plans.

To address these issues and strengthen domestic chip production, the Trump administration is reportedly considering taking action.

### Details of the Potential Deal

According to reports from *Bloomberg* and *The New York Times*, the administration is discussing acquiring a **10 percent stake** in Intel. The idea is to boost US chip manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign sources.

One potential approach involves converting the **$10.86 billion** in federal grants Intel is slated to receive from the US Chips and Science Act into equity. This would effectively give the government a ownership stake in exchange for the funding.

However, discussions are still in the early stages, and the exact size and terms of the potential deal are yet to be finalized.

### What This Means for Intel

Government ownership could bring both benefits and challenges for Intel:

*   **Financial boost:** Government investment could provide much-needed capital to support Intel's operations and expansion plans.
*   **Strategic alignment:** Government involvement could align Intel's goals with national interests, particularly in securing the US semiconductor supply chain.
*   **Potential oversight:** Government ownership could also lead to increased scrutiny and potential interference in Intel's business decisions.



### Intel's Response

Intel has acknowledged the Trump administration's efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership. In a statement to *Bloomberg*, a company representative stated, "We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation."

### The Bigger Picture: US Chip Manufacturing

This potential deal highlights the growing importance of domestic chip manufacturing. Semiconductors are essential components in countless products, from smartphones and computers to cars and medical devices. Ensuring a reliable supply of chips is crucial for economic competitiveness and national security.
