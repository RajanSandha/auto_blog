## Ballistic Ventures Explodes Onto the Scene: $100M Fundraise Fuels Cybersecurity Investments

The cybersecurity investment landscape is heating up, and Ballistic Ventures is leading the charge.  This San Francisco-based venture capital firm, co-founded by the legendary Ted Schlein (formerly of Kleiner Perkins), is raising a staggering $100 million for a new fund, according to a recent SEC filing. This significant capital infusion comes just over a year after the firm closed its second fund, a substantial $360 million investment.

### A Powerhouse Team Targeting High-Growth Cybersecurity Startups

Ballistic Ventures, established in late 2021, focuses exclusively on cybersecurity startups.  Their success isn't just about financial backing; it's about providing comprehensive support.  In previous interviews, Schlein highlighted the firm's hands-on approach.  The Ballistic team, boasting years of collective experience, actively participates in portfolio companies' growth, taking board seats, assisting with hiring strategies, and even helping secure those crucial first ten customers.  Schlein emphasized their commitment to frequent engagement, often communicating with founders multiple times a week.

This level of involvement isn't surprising given the team's composition.  Alongside Schlein, four other general partners—Kevin Mandia, Barmak Meftah, Jake Seid, and Roger Thornton—bring a wealth of expertise and connections to the table.  Further strengthening their cybersecurity prowess, Ballistic appointed former USPS CISO Gregory Crabb as CISO-in-residence, filling the role vacated by David Hahn's promotion to CISO operating partner. This strategic move underscores their dedication to providing unparalleled guidance and support within the cybersecurity domain.

### A Proven Track Record and Strategic Investments

Ballistic Ventures' commitment to the cybersecurity sector is evident in their portfolio.  According to Crunchbase, they've already invested in 59 promising startups, with the recent $17.5 million Series A round for GetReal Lab being the latest addition.  This robust investment strategy, coupled with six successful exits, showcases their ability to identify and nurture high-growth potential within the cybersecurity industry.  Their strategic investments are not simply about returns; they're about shaping the future of cybersecurity.

### Riding the Wave of Cybersecurity Investment Growth

Ballistic Ventures' significant fundraise arrives at a time of explosive growth within the cybersecurity investment market.  According to a Crunchbase News report, venture funding in cybersecurity surged by 43% year-over-year in 2024, reaching a remarkable $11.6 billion. While the number of deals decreased slightly from 821 in 2023 to 639 in 2024, the sheer volume of capital invested underscores the industry's continued importance and potential.

This surge in investment reflects the ever-increasing demand for robust cybersecurity solutions in a world facing increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.  Ballistic Ventures is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this trend, leveraging its extensive network, hands-on approach, and deep industry expertise to drive the success of its portfolio companies.

###  Looking Ahead: Ballistic Ventures' Impact on the Cybersecurity Landscape

While Ballistic Ventures declined to comment directly on the fundraise, the sheer scale of the investment speaks volumes.  This $100 million injection will undoubtedly fuel further growth and expansion, enabling the firm to support even more innovative cybersecurity startups.  Their focus on providing comprehensive support, beyond just capital, positions them as a crucial partner for entrepreneurs navigating the complexities of the cybersecurity market.

The future of cybersecurity is bright, and with Ballistic Ventures at the helm, guiding and investing in cutting-edge solutions, the industry is poised for even greater innovation and growth. The firm's strategic approach, coupled with its impressive team and track record, makes it a key player to watch in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity investment.

### Conclusion: A Bold Investment in a Critical Sector

Ballistic Ventures' $100 million fundraise is more than just a financial milestone; it's a bold statement about the firm's unwavering commitment to the cybersecurity sector.  Their hands-on approach, combined with their extensive network and proven track record, positions them as a vital force in shaping the future of cybersecurity.  With this significant capital injection, Ballistic Ventures is set to further solidify its position as a leading investor in the rapidly evolving world of cybersecurity innovation.
