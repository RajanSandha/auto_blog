### What is Pips?

Pips is a single-player puzzle game from the New York Times Games. It takes the core mechanics of dominoes and adds color-coded constraints to make for a brain-teasing experience. It's available on the NYT Games website and is designed to be played daily.

### How to Play Pips: A Quick Guide

If you're familiar with dominoes, you'll quickly grasp the basics of Pips. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Tile Placement:** Like dominoes, tiles are placed either vertically or horizontally, connecting with each other.
*   **Color-Coded Conditions:** This is where Pips gets interesting. Certain spaces on the board are color-coded, and these colors dictate specific conditions you must meet with the domino tiles placed within them. The touching tiles do not necessarily have to match.
*   **Meeting the Conditions:** The conditions are based on the pips (dots) on the domino tiles. These conditions can be:
    *   **Number:** The sum of all pips in the colored space must equal the given number.
    *   **Equal:** Every domino half within the space must have the same number of pips.
    *   **Not Equal:** Each domino half in the space must have a different number of pips.
    *   **Less Than:** Each domino half in the space must have a pip count less than the given number.
    *   **Greater Than:** Each domino half in the space must have a pip count greater than the given number.
*   **Uncolored Spaces:** If a space has no color coding, there are no restrictions on the dominoes placed there.

### Understanding the Color-Coded Conditions in Pips

The color-coded conditions are the heart of the **Pips game**. They add a layer of complexity that turns a simple domino game into a challenging puzzle. Remember, it's common for only half of a domino tile to be within a colored space, so pay close attention to which pips are being counted.
