## What is NYT Strands?

Strands is a word search game with a unique twist. Unlike traditional word searches, the words in Strands can bend and turn in any direction – up, down, left, right, or diagonally. Every letter in the grid is part of an answer, and all the found words are connected by a common theme. The goal is to identify all the theme words and the "spangram," a special word or phrase that encapsulates the theme and stretches across the entire grid, either horizontally or vertically.

Strands differentiates itself from other NYT games like Wordle and Connections by offering an opaque hint system. This adds to the challenge and requires players to spend more time thinking through the puzzle.

## Understanding the Strands Challenge

The game presents a grid of letters, and your task is to identify words that fit a specific theme. These words can be arranged in any direction, adding to the complexity. What sets Strands apart is the "spangram" – a word or phrase that not only represents the theme but also spans the entire grid. This adds an extra layer of discovery to the game.
