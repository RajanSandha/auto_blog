## Bite Into These Reads: Vampire Books Perfect for a Weekend Escape

Looking for a thrilling escape this weekend? Sink your teeth into these captivating reads featuring vampires and gothic intrigue. We've curated a list of recently released titles that are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Get ready to add some *bite* to your reading list!

This week, we're diving into *Hungerstone*, a modern retelling of Sheridan Le Fanu's classic *Carmilla*, and *Blood Type*, EC Comics' exciting first serialized miniseries. Let's explore these fascinating stories.

## *Hungerstone*: A Sapphic Vampire Tale Reimagined

*Hungerstone*, written by Sheridan Le Fanu, has been on my radar for a while, and I finally had the chance to delve into this retelling of the original sapphic vampire story, *Carmilla*. What a perfect read during Pride Month!

This gothic novel centers around Lenore, who's been uprooted from London and relocated to the British moorlands by her husband, Henry, to advance his career. Henry isn't exactly the ideal partner, and Lenore is longing for companionship. Enter Carmilla. The story unfolds with yearning and undeniable chemistry.

### The Allure of Carmilla

Carmilla arrives after a carriage accident, seeking refuge. Her extended stay makes everyone uneasy due to her peculiar habits â€“ wandering at night and abstaining from food during mealtimes. From the moment she appears, Lenore is captivated. Lenore experiences strange dreams, and girls in a nearby village begin falling ill with a mysterious disease. Sound familiar?

While the core elements are recognizable, *Hungerstone* introduces significant differences from the original novella.

### Modern Themes and Feminine Rage

*Hungerstone* delves deeper into themes of industrialization and the societal expectations and treatment of women during that era. It delivers powerful moments of feminine rage and satisfying justice.

**Key Features of *Hungerstone*:**

*   Gothic atmosphere
*   Exploration of sapphic themes
*   Critique of societal norms
*   Strong female characters



## *Blood Type*: EC Comics' Bloody Good Time

*Blood Type*, crafted by Corinna Bechko and Andrea Sorrentino, marks the first serialized miniseries from EC Comics, a publisher known for its anthologies that recently made a comeback after a long hiatus. We were first introduced to the bloodthirsty vampiress Ada in the third issue of EC's *Epitaphs of the Abyss*, but she now stars in her own spinoff.

### A Summer Horror Treat

*Blood Type* #1 is the perfect horror read for the start of summer. A vampire, who has been preying on sailors at sea, docks on a vacation island only to discover that another evil has already taken root there. It's gory, with a perfect balance of dark humor. It's a pretty good time overall. Well, not for everyone *in* the story (except Ada), but I'm certainly having fun.

### What Makes *Blood Type* Stand Out?

*   Fast-paced plot
*   Intriguing characters
*   Unique blend of horror and humor
*   Stunning visuals

**Why You Should Read *Blood Type*:**

*   It's a fresh take on the vampire genre.
*   The artwork is captivating and adds to the story's atmosphere.
*   It's a fun and engaging read that won't disappoint horror fans.
