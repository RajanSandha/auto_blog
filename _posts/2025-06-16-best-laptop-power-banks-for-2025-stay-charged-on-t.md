## What to Look for in a Laptop Power Bank

Choosing the right **laptop power bank** involves considering several factors. Let's break down the key aspects to ensure you pick the perfect one for your needs.

### Flying with a Laptop Power Bank

Traveling with a **portable charger** requires understanding airline regulations. The TSA limits carry-on batteries to 100Wh (Watt-hours) or less. This translates to roughly 27,000mAh. *Important: No portable batteries are allowed in checked luggage due to fire risk.* [link to TSA guidelines]

Recently, some airlines have started implementing stricter rules. For example, Southwest Airlines requires passengers to keep **power banks** in clear view while in use. It's always a good idea to check with your specific airline before you fly. [link to Southwest Airlines policy]

### Capacity

**Capacity** is measured in milliamp-hours (mAh). For simply keeping your smartphone alive, just about . However, to charge a laptop effectively, you'll need a higher capacity, typically between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh.

Keep in mind that the listed capacity isn't the actual power delivered to your devices. Voltage differences and energy conversion during charging cause some energy loss. A 25,000mAh power bank might only charge a laptop with a 5,000mAh battery to around 75%. During testing, expect an efficiency rate of around 60% between the power bank's listed capacity and the actual charge delivered.

### Ports

Most large **power banks** come equipped with multiple USB ports, including USB-C and USB-A. This allows you to charge various devices like earbuds, phones, tablets, and laptops.

Pay attention to the wattage rating of each port. Some ports might offer 60W, while others can deliver 100W. If your device supports fast charging (e.g., a MacBook Air), use the higher wattage port for optimal charging speeds.

Don't worry about plugging a low-wattage device into a high-wattage port. Devices only draw the power they need. However, ensure that the port, device, and charging cable all meet or exceed the desired wattage rating for maximum charging rates.

Some **portable batteries** include AC ports. While tempting, avoid using these for laptops. Plugging your laptop's power adapter into the AC port wastes energy through unnecessary DC-to-AC-to-DC conversion. It's more efficient to use a USB-C port for direct DC power transfer.

You can use multiple ports simultaneously, but charging speeds will likely decrease, and the battery will drain faster.

### Wireless Charging

**Wireless charging** on **power banks** has improved significantly. While early versions were slow, newer models offer impressive speeds, especially for Samsung Galaxy phones. However, wireless charging is less efficient than wired charging. If efficiency is a priority, stick to wired connections.

### Design

**Power banks** are designed for portability, but laptop-compatible models can be bulky. Expect them to weigh between 1.5 and 2 pounds. Many include a display showing the remaining charge, which is helpful for managing power usage.

Wireless charging pads are typically located on the top surface, while AC ports are often found on one end. Remember to check for power buttons or switches to activate charging features.

## How We Test Portable Laptop Chargers

To evaluate **portable laptop chargers**, we conduct thorough testing using a variety of devices, including:

*   Apple iPhone 15
*   Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra
*   M1 iPad Air
*   16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip

We drain the batteries of phones and tablets to between 0% and 5% and charge them without using the device. For the MacBook, we let it run down to 10% before plugging in the **power bank** and use it in a typical mobile office scenario (Bluetooth keyboard/mouse, Wi-Fi, VPN).

During each test, we record the time required to reach a full charge and the amount of battery capacity used. We also consider factors like portability, durability, features, and overall design.

For reference, here are the battery capacities of the devices we use:

*   iPhone 15: 3,349mAh
*   Galaxy S23 Ultra: 4,855mAh
*   iPad Air (5th gen): 7,729mAh
*   16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh

## Laptop Power Bank FAQs

Let's address some common questions about **laptop power banks**:

### How do laptop power banks differ from phone power banks?

The main difference is **capacity**. Phone **power banks** typically range from 5,000mAh to 20,000mAh, while **laptop power banks** are generally rated between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh. Laptop batteries are larger and require more power for a meaningful charge.

### How do you fast charge a power bank?

The charging speed is limited by the **power bank's** internal mechanisms. To maximize charging speed, use a wall adapter and USB-C cable with high wattage ratings. A 65W wall charger and 100W cable will charge your **power bank** much faster than a 5W power brick and 10W cable.

### What size power bank do I need for a laptop?

Look for a **power bank** with a rating of at least 20,000mAh. Smaller batteries might work but won't provide a significant charge to most laptops.

### How many mAh to charge a laptop?

Any **battery** rated at 20,000mAh or above should be able to charge your laptop. However, using watt-hours (Wh) is a better gauge due to voltage differences between **power banks** and laptop batteries. [link to watt-hour calculator]

## Recent Updates

**June 2025**: Added updated information on airline regulations pertaining to **battery banks**.

## Conclusion: Power Up Your Productivity

A reliable **laptop power bank** is an essential tool for anyone who needs to work or play on the go. By understanding the key factors discussed in this guide, you can confidently choose a **portable charger** that meets your specific needs and keeps your laptop powered up, no matter where life takes you. Stay charged, stay productive!
