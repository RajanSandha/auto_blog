## AMD's Beastly 96-Core Threadripper Pro: Power & Price Revealed

AMD is unleashing a new monster in the CPU world: the Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9000 WX-Series. These processors, built on the Zen 5 architecture, are designed for high-end workstations and promise to deliver incredible performance for professionals. But all that power comes at a price â€“ a hefty one.

### The King: Threadripper Pro 9995WX

The top dog of the series, the Threadripper Pro 9995WX, boasts a whopping 96 cores and 192 threads. This CPU is designed for the most demanding tasks, from complex simulations to high-resolution video editing. It will be available starting July 23rd, but be prepared to shell out **$11,699** for this powerhouse.

### What's New in the 9000 WX-Series?

*   **Zen 5 Architecture:** The latest generation of AMD's CPU architecture, offering improved performance and efficiency.
*   **High Core Counts:** Up to 96 cores for extreme multitasking and parallel processing.
*   **Professional Workloads:** Optimized for applications like Chaos V-Ray and Adobe After Effects.
*   **AI Capabilities:** Designed for local AI deployments, including model fine-tuning and inference.

### Other Options (and Prices)

If the 9995WX is a bit too rich for your blood, AMD offers several other Threadripper Pro 9000 WX-Series processors:

*   **Threadripper Pro 9985WX (64 cores):** $7,999
*   **Threadripper Pro 9975WX (32 cores):** $4,099
*   **Threadripper Pro 9965WX (24 cores):** $2,899
*   **Threadripper Pro 9955WX (16 cores):** $1,649

No matter which model you choose, you're getting a CPU designed to handle demanding professional workloads.

### Who Is This For?

The Threadripper Pro 9000 WX-Series is aimed squarely at professionals who need the absolute best performance for their workstations. This includes:

*   **3D Artists and Animators:** Rendering complex scenes and simulations.
*   **Video Editors:** Working with high-resolution footage and demanding effects.
*   **Software Developers:** Compiling code and running virtual machines.
*   **Data Scientists:** Training and deploying AI models.

If you're a gamer, these CPUs are likely overkill. While they could certainly handle gaming, the price-to-performance ratio isn't ideal compared to CPUs designed specifically for gaming.

### AI Performance Boost

AMD is also highlighting the AI capabilities of the Threadripper Pro 9000 WX-Series. They claim that these processors offer significantly better performance in local AI deployments compared to the competition. According to AMD, the Threadripper Pro 9000 series shows a "49 percent better performance of Threadripper Pro 9000 over Intel" when running a context-based prompting inference test using DeepSeek R1 32B.

This makes them an attractive option for developers and researchers who need to fine-tune models, perform inference, and develop AI applications locally, without relying on cloud-based services.

### Availability

Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro will all be offering high-end workstations with the Threadripper 9000 series starting July 23rd. DIY builders will also be able to purchase the processors through AMD's channel partners.

### What About the Non-Pro Threadrippers?

AMD hasn't yet revealed pricing for the non-Pro Threadripper 9980X and 9970X processors. These are expected to be more affordable options for DIY builders. Keep an eye out for more information on these CPUs in the coming weeks.

A: AMD hasn't announced a release date yet. Stay tuned for updates.

**Q: Where can I buy these CPUs?**
A: From major workstation vendors (Dell, HP, Lenovo, Supermicro) and AMD's channel partners.

### Key Takeaways:

*   AMD's Threadripper Pro 9000 WX-Series offers extreme performance for professional workloads.
*   The top-end 9995WX features 96 cores and costs $11,699.
*   These CPUs are optimized for rendering, video editing, AI development, and other demanding tasks.
*   Consider your needs and budget carefully before investing in a Threadripper Pro.

This new series of **AMD** processors is set to shake up the workstation market. It will be interesting to see how they perform in real-world scenarios and how they compare to Intel's offerings. The **Threadripper** line has always been about pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and the 9000 WX-Series is no exception.
