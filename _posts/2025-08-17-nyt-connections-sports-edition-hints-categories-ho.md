### What is *Connections: Sports Edition*?

*Connections: Sports Edition* is a daily word game created by *The New York Times* in collaboration with *The Athletic*, their sports journalism arm. The goal is simple: group four words that share a common theme or connection. But don't be fooled, it is more challenging than you think!

You can play *Connections* on your web browser or mobile device. The game presents you with 16 words, and your task is to identify the four groups of four that connect them. These categories can range from anything related to sports, such as types of plays, famous athletes, sports equipment, or even more abstract concepts linked to the world of sports.

Here's a quick rundown of the rules:

*   **16 words:** You're given sixteen seemingly random words.
*   **Four Categories:** These words can be divided into four groups, with four words per group.
*   **Find the Connections:** Your job is to figure out what links the words in each group.
*   **Four Mistakes Allowed:** You can make up to four incorrect guesses before the game ends.
*   **Color-Coded Difficulty:** The categories are color-coded, with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.
*   **Share Your Results:** Just like *Wordle*, you can share your score and progress on social media.

### Tips & Strategies for Playing Connections

*   **Look for Obvious Connections First:** Start by identifying the easiest and most obvious connections. This can help you narrow down the possibilities and eliminate words from consideration.
*   **Consider Different Meanings:** Some words may have multiple meanings. Think about how a word could relate to sports in different ways.
*   **Shuffle the Board:** Don't be afraid to shuffle the board to get a fresh perspective. This can sometimes help you see connections you might have missed before.
*   **Use Your Mistakes Wisely:** If you're unsure, try a guess. Even if it's wrong, it can give you valuable information about which words might not belong together.
*   **Think Outside the Box:** Sometimes the connections are not immediately obvious. Be prepared to think creatively and consider less common associations.
