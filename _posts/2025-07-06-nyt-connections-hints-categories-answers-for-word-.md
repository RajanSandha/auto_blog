### What is NYT Connections?

*Connections* is a word association game where you need to group 16 words into four categories of four words each.  Think of it as finding the "common threads between words." It's the brainchild of the *NYT*'s associate puzzle editor, Wyna Liu.

The game is available on the *New York Times* website and mobile app. Each day brings a new puzzle, and the difficulty can vary. Some days the connections are obvious, and other days they require some serious mental gymnastics. The goal is to solve the puzzle with as few mistakes as possible â€“ you only get four!  You can even shuffle the board around to see the words in a new order and hopefully spot some new connections.

*   **How to Play:** Group four words that share a common theme or connection.
*   **Difficulty Levels:** Categories are color-coded: Yellow (easiest), Green, Blue, and Purple (hardest).
*   **Mistakes Matter:** You have only four attempts before the game ends.
*   **Share Your Success:**  Like *Wordle*, you can share your results with friends on social media.

### Strategies for Solving Connections Puzzles

Before we dive into today's hints, here are a few general strategies to keep in mind:

*   **Look for Obvious Connections:** Start by identifying the easiest categories.  This will eliminate words and make it easier to spot the more difficult connections.
*   **Consider Multiple Meanings:** Some words have multiple meanings.  Think about all the possible interpretations of a word.
*   **Think Outside the Box:** Don't be afraid to get creative!  The connections might not always be literal.
*   **Use the Shuffle Feature:** Rearranging the board can help you see the words in a new light.
*   **Eliminate as You Go:** As you identify categories, the remaining words become easier to analyze.
