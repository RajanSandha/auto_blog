# Apple's Bold Design Overhaul: What to Expect from iOS, iPadOS, and macOS

Apple is gearing up for a significant transformation of its operating systems, with reports indicating a dramatic redesign of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS set to roll out later this year. This overhaul, anticipated with the release of iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16, aims to refresh the visual aesthetics and user experience across all Apple devices.

## A New Look for Apple's Ecosystem

According to a report from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/apple-readies-dramatic-design-overhauls-for-ios-19-ipados-19-and-macos-16?srnd=undefined&sref=9hGJlFio), this design revamp will impact various elements of the operating systems, including:
- Icons
- Menus
- Apps
- Windows
- System buttons

These changes are not merely cosmetic; they are intended to enhance usability and create a more cohesive and intuitive experience for users across Apple’s software ecosystem.

### Inspired by Vision Pro’s visionOS

Interestingly, the new design is said to draw inspiration from the recently introduced Vision Pro’s visionOS. This suggests that Apple is looking to incorporate modern design principles and functionalities that align with its latest innovations. The goal is to create a seamless experience that simplifies user interactions while maintaining the unique character of each operating system.

## A Historical Perspective on Design Changes

As reported, this will mark the most significant design update for macOS since the launch of [macOS Big Sur](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1) and the most substantial change for iOS since the revolutionary [iOS 7](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/2/23745728/apple-iphone-ios-7-transformed-10-years-ago). Both of these previous updates reshaped the way users interacted with their devices, indicating that this upcoming overhaul could similarly redefine the Apple experience.

### User-Centric Enhancements

Apple's updates are designed with user experience in mind. The company aims to simplify how people use their devices, ensuring that tasks are more straightforward and intuitive. By maintaining consistency across software platforms, Apple hopes to make it easier for users to transition between devices, whether they are using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

## What to Expect at the Worldwide Developers Conference

The details of these changes are likely to be unveiled at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which is typically held in June. While a specific date for this year’s event has not yet been announced, anticipation is building among developers and users alike. The WWDC is a crucial platform for Apple to showcase its latest developments, and this year’s conference is expected to be particularly exciting given the scope of the upcoming design updates.

### Conclusion: A New Era for Apple Software

As Apple prepares to launch these significant design changes, the tech community is buzzing with speculation and excitement. The anticipated updates for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS promise to not only refresh the aesthetic appeal of Apple devices but also enhance usability and user satisfaction. With a focus on creating a consistent experience across its platforms, Apple is reaffirming its commitment to innovation and user-centric design.

Stay tuned for more updates as we approach the WWDC, where Apple is expected to reveal more about these exciting changes. This overhaul could very well set the stage for a new era in Apple software, one that embraces modern design while staying true to the brand's core values.
