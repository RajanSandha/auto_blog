## Bang & Olufsen Beoplay A1 (Gen 3) Review: Still a Top Pick?

Bang & Olufsen's Beoplay A1 Bluetooth speaker has always been a head-turner. The original, launched back in 2016, stood out from the crowd of rubberized speakers with its stylish, brushed aluminum design. Now, the third generation is here, and it's more than just a pretty face. Let's dive into what makes the Beoplay A1 (Gen 3) a compelling choice, and where it might fall short.

### What's New in the Beoplay A1 (Gen 3)?

While the overall look remains similar to its predecessors, the A1 (Gen 3) has undergone some significant internal upgrades. Here's a quick rundown:

*   **New Colors:** Honey Tone and Eucalyptus Green join the classic aluminum finish.
*   **Improved Sound:** B&O claims the A1 (Gen 3) has the largest woofer in its class (3Â¼ inch), resulting in a richer, more powerful sound with a claimed bass SPL of 64 dB.
*   **Extended Battery Life:** Enjoy up to 24 hours of playtime, up from 18 hours in the previous generation.
*   **Sustainability Focus:** The A1 (Gen 3) is the world's first Cradle to Cradle Certified (Bronze level) Bluetooth speaker, meaning it's designed for repairability and upgrades.
*   **Alexa, Goodbye:** B&O removed Alexa voice assistant due to lack of user interest. It still functions as a speakerphone.

### Premium Design and Build Quality

The Beoplay A1 (Gen 3) feels every bit as luxurious as its $399 price tag suggests. The aluminum construction is flawless, and the leather strap adds a touch of elegance. It's a speaker you'll be proud to display.

### Sound Quality: Impressive for its Size

Powered by two 30-watt Class D amplifiers, the A1 (Gen 3) delivers impressive 360-degree audio. The larger woofer makes a noticeable difference, providing a warmer and richer sound compared to the previous generation. The highs are crisp and clear, and the bass is surprisingly deep for a speaker of this size.

### Sustainability: A Step in the Right Direction

One of the most compelling aspects of the A1 (Gen 3) is its focus on sustainability. The modular design allows for repairs and upgrades, extending the speaker's lifespan. Batteries can be replaced at Bang & Olufsen stores, reducing electronic waste. This commitment to longevity helps justify the premium price.

### Connectivity and Features

The A1 (Gen 3) features Bluetooth 5.1, multipoint connectivity, stereo pairing, and aptX Adaptive compatibility. It's also IP67-rated for dust and water resistance, making it perfect for outdoor use. The USB-C port can be used for charging and data transfer (for future upgrades).

### The Competition

While the Beoplay A1 (Gen 3) is an excellent speaker, it faces stiff competition. The JBL Flip 7, for example, offers similar features and great sound quality for a significantly lower price. However, the A1 (Gen 3) stands out with its premium design, build quality, and commitment to sustainability.

### Is the Beoplay A1 (Gen 3) Right for You?

The Beoplay A1 (Gen 3) is a great choice if you value design, sound quality, and sustainability. It's perfect for use at home, in the office, or on the go. However, if you're on a tight budget, there are other options that offer similar features for less.

**Actionable Takeaway:** If you already own the Beoplay A1 (Gen 2) and are happy with its sound, the upgrade might not be worth the $399 price tag. However, if you're looking for a premium, sustainable, and great-sounding Bluetooth speaker, the A1 (Gen 3) is definitely worth considering.

### Pros:

*   Stunning design and build quality
*   Impressive sound for its size

*   Excellent battery life

### Cons:

*   Expensive
