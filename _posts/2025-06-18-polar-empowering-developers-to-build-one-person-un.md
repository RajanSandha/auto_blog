## Polar: Empowering Developers to Build One-Person Unicorns Post-Shopify

The rise of AI has sparked a fascinating trend: the emergence of **one-person unicorn** companies. Imagine a single individual building a billion-dollar startup – a concept that seemed impossible just a few years ago. But with the power of AI and innovative platforms like Polar, this dream is becoming a reality. Birk Jernström, the CEO of **Polar**, is on a mission to empower these solo entrepreneurs, leveraging his experience from his previous startup, Tictail, acquired by Shopify.

### The One-Person Unicorn Dream

Sam Altman and other tech leaders are even placing bets on when we'll see the first one-person billion-dollar company. This highlights the growing belief in the potential of individuals to create significant value, especially with the help of AI-driven tools. These AI-first businesses are popping up everywhere, and Polar is ready to provide the infrastructure they need to succeed.

### What is Polar?

Polar is a "monetization platform" specifically designed to help these **one-person unicorns** thrive. It aims to simplify the complexities of selling online products and SaaS subscriptions globally. Think of it as a comprehensive toolkit for developers who want to focus on building great software, without getting bogged down in the intricacies of billing and taxes.

### Polar's Unique Approach: Focusing on Developers

While other payment infrastructure platforms exist, Polar distinguishes itself by prioritizing the needs of developers. It acts as a 'Merchant of Record,' handling billing, taxes, and other financial aspects, allowing developers to sell their products and subscriptions from day one, no matter where their customers are located.

*   **Simplified Implementation:** Polar can be integrated into existing systems with just a few lines of code.
*   **Global Reach:** Seamlessly sell to customers worldwide without worrying about international regulations.
*   **Focus on Building:** Spend more time on developing your product and less time on administrative tasks.

This developer-centric approach resonated with Accel, a prominent VC firm, leading to a $10 million seed round for Polar. Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel, noted that Polar caters to the new generation of AI-native businesses that prioritize growth without distractions.

### Birk Jernström's Journey: From Tictail to Polar

Jernström's credibility is further bolstered by his successful exit with Tictail, a startup acquired by Shopify in 2018. Tictail aimed to simplify online selling, making it as easy as creating a blog.

"In 2011, we started Tictail with the mission of empowering anyone to **start an online store**. We launched in 2012 and it quickly took off. In a couple of years, we were home to 100,000+ merchants on the platform, very much on the long tail," Jernström said.

Tictail's success in building a marketplace eventually attracted the attention of Shopify. After Shopify's IPO, they recognized the need to focus on the consumer side and believed that Tictail's team could contribute to this effort.

### Lessons Learned at Shopify

Following the acquisition, Jernström and his team joined Shopify's newly formed Shop team, which eventually evolved into the Shop app and the Shop Pay ecosystem. Jernström played a key role in building and scaling this ecosystem from the ground up.

However, in 2021, a period of self-reflection led Jernström to resign from his remote role and embark on a new venture: Polar. The split was amicable, with Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke and president Harley Finkelstein even backing Polar as angel investors. This demonstrates the strong relationships Jernström built and the respect he garnered within the industry.

### A Merchant-Obsessed Culture

Jernström emphasizes the importance of understanding his customer base. He personally answers numerous support tickets daily to gain insights into their needs and challenges. This dedication reflects the "merchant-obsessed" culture he absorbed at Shopify.

"I answer more than 50 or 60 support tickets a day. I know every single customer that we work with, and it’s a bit crazy, but I just love understanding what their next steps are in their journey, and what Polar can do to make that easier for them," he said.

### Open Source and Rapid Growth

Polar's commitment to being **open source** and understanding its users has fueled its rapid growth. Since launching in September 2024, the startup has attracted 18,000 customers, primarily developers monetizing software.

This growth is also reflected in Polar's cap table, which includes founders of popular developer tools such as Framer, Raycast, Dub, Nuxt, Resend, Supabase, Vercel, WorkOS, and Lovable. These individuals are not just investors; they are also users and advocates of Polar's platform.

### The Future of Developer Entrepreneurship

Jernström's vision for Polar aligns with the growing trend of **low code development** and the increasing accessibility of powerful tools. He aims to make building a business around software as easy as building and scaling the software itself, similar to platforms like Supabase and Vercel.

This vision is fueled by the momentum created by AI, empowering both indie hackers and professional developers. It also connects with Jernström's personal experiences, from growing up with an entrepreneurial mother to being a developer since his teens and his previous venture with Tictail.

### Empowering the Next Generation of Developers

"What I want Polar to achieve is similar to Shopify: How do we empower more entrepreneurship of developers that can actually build and follow their own passions and ship software independently and build businesses around that."

Polar is not just a payment platform; it's a catalyst for developer entrepreneurship. It's empowering individuals to build their own **one-person unicorns** and shape the future of software development.
