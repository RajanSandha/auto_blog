## Honda & Acura EVs Tap Into Tesla Supercharger Network: What It Means For You

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is accelerating, and a key piece of the puzzle is readily available charging infrastructure. In a significant move, Honda and Acura EV owners can now access the expansive Tesla Supercharger network, thanks to a newly released, Honda-approved NACS-CCS adapter.

This means more charging options and greater convenience for drivers of the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX, the current all-electric offerings from Honda and its luxury brand. Let's dive into what this partnership entails and why it's a win for EV owners.

### Why This Matters: Expanding Charging Options

One of the biggest anxieties for EV owners is range anxiety â€“ the fear of running out of charge before reaching a charging station. Access to the Tesla Supercharger network, with over 23,500 chargers, significantly alleviates this concern for Honda and Acura EV drivers.

Ryan Harty, assistant vice president of Sustainability and Business Development at American Honda Motor Company, highlights the importance of this expansion: "Combined with other growing charging networks, Honda and Acura EV drivers now have added peace of mind with a wider range of dependable DC fast charging options nationwide."

### How Honda and Acura EV Owners Can Access Tesla Superchargers

The process is straightforward:

*   **Get the Adapter:** Purchase the Honda-approved NACS-CCS adapter from your local Honda or Acura dealership, or online. The adapter retails for $225.
*   **Navigate via Google Maps:** Tesla Superchargers are now integrated into the built-in Google Maps navigation system in the Prologue and ZDX, making it easy to find nearby charging locations.
*   **Use the Tesla App:** Once you arrive at a Supercharger, use the Tesla app to initiate and manage the charging session.

### Future Integration: Plug and Charge

Honda is working on integrating plug-and-charge functionality directly into the HondaLink and Acura EV apps. This will allow for a seamless charging experience, eliminating the need to use the Tesla app. Stay tuned for updates on this feature!

### The Bigger Picture: NACS Dominance

This move underscores the growing adoption of the North American Charging Standard (NACS), initially developed by Tesla. Several major automakers have already announced plans to integrate NACS ports into their future EVs, signaling a shift towards a unified charging standard. This increased standardization benefits all EV drivers by simplifying the charging process and expanding charging options.

Some analysts predict that NACS will become the dominant charging standard in North America. According to a report by BloombergNEF, "The transition to NACS will likely accelerate the deployment of faster charging infrastructure, benefiting all EV owners."

### Actionable Takeaway: Get Your Adapter!

If you own a Honda Prologue or Acura ZDX, purchasing the NACS-CCS adapter is a worthwhile investment. It opens up a vast network of fast-charging stations, making road trips and everyday commutes more convenient and stress-free.
