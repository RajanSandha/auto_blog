## Trump Administration Sets Sights on Water and Energy Efficiency Standards

The Trump administration has once again taken aim at regulations designed to conserve water and energy, signaling a potential rollback of consumer protections and environmental safeguards. A recent presidential memorandum directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to explore weakening or rescinding efficiency standards for a range of household appliances, from dishwashers and washing machines to showers and toilets. This move follows a series of actions targeting energy and environmental policies, raising concerns about the future of conservation efforts and their impact on consumers.

## The Presidential Memorandum: What's at Stake?

The presidential memorandum specifically instructs the DOE to consider using all available legal avenues to weaken or eliminate existing water and energy efficiency regulations for dishwashers, washing machines, showers, faucets, toilets, and urinals. These standards are currently in place to encourage manufacturers to produce appliances that use less water and energy, ultimately saving consumers money on their utility bills and reducing the overall environmental impact.

The White House argues that these regulations are burdensome and make life harder for taxpayers. A fact sheet released alongside the memorandum suggests the Secretary of Energy should collaborate with the Office of Legislative Affairs to recommend changes or repeals to water pressure and related energy efficiency laws to Congress.

Furthermore, the memorandum calls for a pause in the enforcement of the mentioned regulations until they are either rescinded or revised. This effectively signals a shift away from actively promoting and enforcing efficiency standards, potentially leading to a market flooded with less efficient appliances.

## Echoes of Past Actions: Targeting Energy Star and Showerheads

This latest action is not an isolated event. It follows earlier reports that the Trump administration considered shuttering the Energy Star program as part of a broader reorganization at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Energy Star is a widely recognized program that certifies products for energy efficiency, allowing consumers to easily identify and choose appliances that meet specific performance standards. Eliminating or weakening the program could make it more difficult for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions and could potentially lead to increased energy consumption.

In April, the president also signed an executive order aimed at making "America's showers great again" by rescinding an Obama-era definition of showerheads that promoted efficiency. This move, while seemingly focused on a single appliance, underscores a broader pattern of targeting regulations designed to conserve resources and protect the environment. The focus on showerheads drew criticism for prioritizing water pressure over water conservation, particularly in regions facing water scarcity.

## Congressional Review Act and Undoing Biden-Era Standards

Adding to the trend, Trump also signed four bills approved through the Congressional Review Act, effectively undoing efficiency standards implemented during the Biden administration. These standards covered a range of appliances, including water heaters, refrigerators, walk-in coolers, and more. The rollback of these standards could have significant implications for energy consumption and utility costs, potentially negating the benefits of previous conservation efforts.

## The Potential Impact: Consumers and the Environment

The potential consequences of weakening or rescinding these efficiency standards are significant. While the administration argues that these regulations are burdensome, experts contend that they actually benefit consumers by reducing their utility bills and promoting innovation in appliance design. Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, points out that eliminating these standards would likely increase costs for consumers.

From an environmental perspective, weakening efficiency standards could lead to increased energy and water consumption, contributing to higher greenhouse gas emissions and straining water resources. This is particularly concerning in the face of growing climate change and water scarcity challenges.

## The Legal Landscape: Can the President Act Unilaterally?

A key question surrounding these actions is the extent to which the president can unilaterally change or eliminate existing regulations. As Andrew deLaski notes, Congress enacted the laws that established these standards, raising questions about the president's authority to simply disregard them. Any attempt to significantly weaken or rescind these regulations is likely to face legal challenges.

The White House fact sheet suggests that the Secretary of Energy will work with Congress to recommend legislative changes, indicating an awareness of the legal limitations on executive action. However, the memorandum's call for a pause in enforcement raises concerns about the administration's commitment to upholding existing laws and regulations.

## Industry Perspectives and Potential Repercussions

While the administration frames these actions as a way to reduce burdens on manufacturers and consumers, the impact on the appliance industry remains to be seen. Some manufacturers may welcome the opportunity to produce less efficient appliances, potentially lowering production costs. However, others may be hesitant to abandon efficiency standards, recognizing the growing consumer demand for energy-saving products.

The rollback of efficiency standards could also have implications for international trade. Countries with stricter efficiency standards may impose barriers on the import of less efficient appliances, potentially harming U.S. manufacturers who choose to produce products that do not meet these standards.

## Conclusion: A Battle Over Efficiency and Conservation

The Trump administration's efforts to weaken or rescind water and energy efficiency standards represent a significant challenge to conservation efforts and consumer protections. While the administration argues that these regulations are burdensome, experts contend that they actually benefit consumers and the environment. The legal and economic implications of these actions remain to be seen, but it is clear that the battle over efficiency and conservation is far from over.

Whether these changes ultimately come to fruition will depend on legal challenges, congressional action, and the evolving dynamics of the appliance market. Consumers, manufacturers, and policymakers will all play a role in shaping the future of water and energy efficiency standards in the years to come.
