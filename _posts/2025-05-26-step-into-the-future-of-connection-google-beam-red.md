## Step Into the Future of Connection: Google Beam Redefines Video Conferencing

Remember the days when video calls felt… flat? Like you were peering at someone through a distant window? Google is aiming to change that with Google Beam, formerly known as Project Starline. Imagine a video call where your conversation partner *literally* pops off the screen in 3D, making you feel like they're right there with you. That's the promise of Google Beam, and after seeing it in action at Google I/O 2025, it's a promise that's closer to reality than ever before.

While the spotlight at Google I/O 2025 was largely on Gemini AI and the exciting Android XR glasses, Google Beam offered a glimpse into a future where distance melts away and video conversations become truly immersive.

## Google Beam: From Project Starline to Reality

For years, Google has been quietly working on Project Starline, a technology designed to transform video calls into stereoscopic, 3D experiences. Now, rebranded as Google Beam, this innovation is poised to enter the real world. During the Google I/O keynote, it was announced that HP will be manufacturing Beam units for commercial and enterprise use by the end of the year. While specific details remain under wraps, these products will leverage the core technology behind the Beam experience, albeit in a form factor resembling conventional TVs.

I had the opportunity to experience a demo of Beam at Google I/O 2025, and the setup was impressive: a 65-inch display surrounded by six cameras mounted in pairs. (HP's commercial versions will integrate these cameras into the bezels.) The AI models that power Beam now run in Google Cloud, and the Beam team has been diligently refining them to enhance the quality and realism of the interactions.

### A More Natural Way to Connect

According to Patrick Seybold, head of communications for Google Beam, users report feeling a significantly stronger sense of connection during meetings conducted via Beam. The team has been rigorously testing the prototype devices internally and with external partners like Salesforce.

Having previously previewed Project Starline back in 2023, I immediately noticed improvements in the Beam experience. The person I was chatting with appeared more detailed and lifelike, truly popping off the screen. It felt far more intimate and engaging than a standard video call. I found myself gesturing more naturally, smiling more broadly, and leaning forward in my chair – all subconscious cues that are often lost in traditional video conferencing.

### The Science Behind the Connection

Google's research, detailed in blog posts and SIGGRAPH white papers, has consistently shown that people interacting with Starline (now Beam) perceive the conversations as "more natural," even if they struggle to articulate why. This suggests that Beam preserves subtle, unconscious behaviors that are crucial for effective communication.

In my own experience, the 3D nature of Beam allowed me to pick up on nuances in body language and gestures that would be imperceptible in a regular video call. I could sense shifts in attention and engagement, leading to a more fluid and natural exchange. There were fewer interruptions and less talking over each other.

### The Ingredients of Immersion

Several factors contribute to the immersive experience of Google Beam. The large 65-inch display commands attention, while the clean, uncluttered environment minimizes distractions. The six cameras track facial movements and ensure that the conversation partner appears at eye level, fostering a sense of direct eye contact.

"There are many ingredients involved to create the feeling of presence and connection that the Google Beam experience facilitates," explains Seybold. "The 3D effect, the eye contact, the natural scale, and other key elements all play a role in facilitating that feeling of immersion."

During the demo, the Beam team member even held out a virtual apple, creating a playful moment that highlighted the sense of proximity. I remember more details of that conversation than I do from some of my video calls from that same week.

"We've run studies in these workplace environments that show people tend to be more attentive and remember more of their conversations when meeting on Google Beam," Seybold said. "We've even run studies and found that people over the course of multiple back-to-back meetings exhibit less meeting fatigue with Google Beam relative to typical video conferencing."

## The Future of Beam: Enterprise and Beyond

While pricing details remain undisclosed, we anticipate learning more when HP unveils its Beam offerings at Infocomm. Google has already secured customers like Deloitte, Salesforce, and Citadel, indicating that the initial focus will be on the enterprise market. This suggests that the first generation of Beam products may be priced beyond the reach of individual consumers.

However, the potential of Google Beam extends far beyond the corporate world. Imagine a future where families can connect in a truly immersive way, bridging geographical distances and fostering a stronger sense of togetherness. While we may not all need a 65-inch display in our living rooms, the underlying technology holds immense promise for transforming how we communicate.

Leaving the Google I/O demo room, I couldn't help but smile. It was a refreshing change from the often-draining experience of conventional video calls, and a glimpse into a future where technology truly enhances human connection.
